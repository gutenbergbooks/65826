cry of hoarse throats, it floats against the hard winds, and binds the
head of the serpent to its tail, the long snail-slow serpent of marching
men. Men weighted down with rifles and knapsacks, and parching with
war. The cry jars and splits against the brazen, burnished sky.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This is the war of wars, and the cause? Has this writhing worm of
men a cause?
</p>

<p>
Crackling against the polished sky is an eagle with a sword. The
eagle is red and its head is flame.

<p class="noindent">
In the shoulder of the worm is a teacher.
</p>

<p>
His tongue laps the war-sucked air in drought, but he yells defiance
at the red-eyed eagle, and in his ears are the bells of new philosophies,
and their tinkling drowns the sputter of the burning sword. He shrieks,
“God damn you! When you are broken the world will strike out new
shoots.”
</p>

<p>
His boots are tight, the sun is hot, and he may be shot, but he is
in the shoulder of the worm.

He laughs at the flaring eagle and makes a long nose with his
fingers. He will fight for smooth, white sheets of paper and uncurdled
ink. The sputtering sword cannot make him blink, and his thoughts
are wet and rippling. They cool his heart.
</p>

<p>
He will tear the eagle out of the sky and give the earth tranquility,
and loveliness printed on white paper.

<p class="noindent">
The eye of the serpent is an owner of mills.
</p>

<p>
He looks at the glaring sword which has snapped his machinery
and struck away his men.
</p>

<p>
But it will all come again, when the sword is broken to a million
dying stars, and there are no more wars.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Bankers, butchers, shopkeepers, painters, farmers,—men, sway and
sweat. They will fight for the earth, for the increase of the slow, sure
roots of peace, for the release of hidden forces. They jibe at the eagle
and his scorching sword.
</p>

<p>
One! Two!—One! Two! clump the heavy boots. The cry hurtles
against the sky.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
Each man pulls his belt a little tighter, and shifts his gun to make
it lighter. Each man thinks of a woman, and slaps out a curse at the
eagle. The sword jumps in the hot sky, and the worm crawls on to the
battle, stubbornly.
</p>

<p>
This is the war of wars, from eye to tail the serpent has one cause:

PEACE!

SCENE:
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
A private dining room in the General’s house in Berlin. It is decorated
in black and white, and designed to impress one with the luxury
of austerity. A chaotic but strong cubist bust in black onyx is at the
left. The dining table, right center, is prepared for a meal. The effect
of the room is that of a subtle beauty compressed and given terrific
force by a military severity. There is a door at the rear and an entrance
for servants at the left.
</p>

<p>
The General enters rear, followed by Marya. He is tall, with a
large mustache and gray hair; his face and figure are in striking harmony
with the room. A man of high intellectual quality; the lines and
angles of his jaw, his mouth, his brows, are almost terrifying in their
massiveness. He is in evening dress, and wears a single crimson order.
Marya likewise is tall, a young woman with dark hair, and of a tense
beauty. She is subtle, yet apparently lacks utterly fear and the softer
qualities. She moves about with an unemphasized superiority over her
surroundings. She wears a red evening gown, low cut to show her
superb shoulders, yet without daring for its own sake. One feels that
she would be equally at ease as a nude Greek goddess.
</p>

<p>
The General seats her at the right of the table, bows, and sits opposite
her. Two servants enter with appetizers; they continue serving
the dinner as the dialogue progresses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General von Buhne</span> (<em>lifting his glass</em>). To a good day’s work.
(<em>She touches hers to her lips</em>) Fräulein Rudinoff, you are superb! I do not
refer to your beauty; any dog could see that. I don’t believe in praise.
But as a sculptor to his statue, allow me to say that of the many secret
agents I have employed, you are the most subtly efficient—cold as ice
and blazing as fire.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"></a>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> Please, Heinrich! I don’t believe in praise either.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Not even when it is for myself? But you are right. Man
does not become strong until he ceases to wonder at his strength.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> That is your secret, I believe.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> My secret, Marya? I do not have secrets. A secret is
something guarded, kept. My mystery, perhaps, yes. That is something
which the many are incapable of discovering—even when it is flaunted
in their faces.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> But we flaunt nothing, you and I.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> No, we stand for everyone to see. My enemies think you
are their spy, and I—know what you are.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> And so, we have them at last where your iron fist can
close on them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Yes, I have them, thanks to you. The poor visionary
fools shall not assassinate the chancellor and blow up the churches.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> You know, we women are supposed to worship the poets.
Well, we do, but we are fascinated and held by men like you. I loved
the comrades, but—as you see——
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> You are right, Marya. I love them, too; that is why—I
crush them. (He laughs shortly.) And perhaps that is why I dominate
you. It is not an effort; it is an instinct. There is something—inevitable—about
our love. That, I think, is because I—am inevitable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> When I first came to you, Heinrich, I hated you. I think I
do still, a little. There is always the zest of hate about the greatest love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> How you echo me! (<em>A silence</em>) Would it surprise you,
my beautiful one, to know that I, like you, was once an anarchist?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> You!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Yes, I, the bugaboo of the democrats, the great reactionary,
the militarist, the apostle of repression, the fortress of the German
Empire. I was once a revolutionist, and I plotted to kill your Czar!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> And yet you failed!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> I am in a whimsical mood tonight. Shall I explain to
you the paradox?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> Tell me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> When I was a young chap I was restless, full of that
driving spirit all healthy youngsters have. The methodical occupations
they gave me in the Fatherland disgusted me. I had money, and I
traveled. So I came to Russia and took up with one of your artistic
groups in an interior city—I won’t tell you which. Believe me, I was
fascinated, lifted out of myself! The great, clean spirit of your intellectual
anarchists, the daily dangers they thrived on, the nonchalance with
which they met death or exile, their daring minds, which ripped the veil
from the future, their beautiful art productions—these things carried me
<a id="page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"></a>
to the height of inspiration. They represented the highest human
quality of which it was possible to dream.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya</span> (<em>covering her eyes with her hand</em>). You have known that, too!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Yes, and love along with it. It was a boy-like worship.
And when my beloved one went to the scaffold it burned into me a
white-hot scar of fearlessness and severity I shall never lose. The love,
I see now, was ephemeral; the scar is eternal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> And why did you leave them? Why did you leave them?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> I had heard of America; I wished to go there and study
the freedom we desired to create in Russia.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> So you went; what then?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> I found a country without a hereditary ruler, one rich in
opportunity, where all men are theoretically equal before the law. I
found a country where even the peasants read and have their magazines,
a country without a state church. It was a land won from the wilderness
by heroic struggle, whose freedom men had died to create, and whose
unity men had died to preserve.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> Did you not breathe more freely there?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Ah, Marya, that was the tragedy! I suffocated! For it
was also a country without a poet, without a musician, without a sculptor,
without a philosopher. The cities were run for loot, and the people,
in whose power everything lay, could not seize the reins. And business—business—business,
everywhere. As I went along the railroads I saw
nothing beside the track but dirty wooden shanties in the cities, nothing
in the country but ugly advertising signs. What do you think was the
best paid and most highly honored profession? Advertising!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> Are you lying to me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> No, it is the truth. Heroism, the love of beauty, the
love of truth—except convenient truth—any sort of high endeavor for
its own sake, was laughed at and crushed in those people by the dull
weight of prosperity. That whole nation was an ugly monument to the
triumph of the commonplace, a stone over the grave of godlike aspiration.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> But surely they have improved since then?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Do you know why they put up new buildings? Because
some millionaire who sells worthless things for five and ten cents wishes
to make money renting offices; because some railroad or insurance company
wishes to get advertising space in the papers without paying for it.
Do you know why the clergymen preach honesty? So that business conditions
may not be disturbed! Do you know for what purpose the
magazines accept stories and articles? So that they may gain the largest
possible public to offer up to their advertising men! Whenever an artist
appears, he is either ignored or scoffed at by that bestial monster, the
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
majority! It is like a prehistoric animal taking up the whole earth with
his vast bulk, seizing everything beautiful for food with which to stuff
his maw, and poisoning the air with the breath of his indigestion.
(<em>He rises and goes to the sideboard, where he busies himself selecting a
cigar. As his back is turned, Marya quickly empties a powder into his
glass. As he comes back and seats himself, she lifts her glass.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> Then let us toast Russia, General! (<em>They drain their glasses.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Would you mind telling me, Marya, how long I have to
live? (<em>He lights his cigar.</em>) You are surprised? But that does not suit you.
You should have known me better than to think I did not know what
you would do when I turned my back tonight.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya</span> (<em>rising, pale</em>): About a minute, General.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Then let us use the time well. Now we can be perfectly
frank. Why have you—(<em>He waves his hand in the direction of the empty
glass.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> Because I am true to my cause! Because you are the
scourge of Germany; you represent everything we hate, every cruelty,
every oppression, every evil thing of the past. I have lived for this
moment for years!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Ah, you are beautiful! In you is my reward! And do
you renounce your love, too?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> I have loved you—more than I knew how to bear. Do
not think I shall live after you. And yet—I had to kill you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> Now I am ready to die. My work is done. I have produced
the beauty I desired!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> You? What do you mean?
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> You, who know how to kill what you love, can ask that?
To produce the rebellion in Germany, to make heroes with the scourge—that
has been my life! I, too, have lived for this moment! To be loved
by a woman with a flaming soul, a woman who is greater than her love!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya</span> (<em>Springing to him as he weakens</em>): Stay with me! Come back
to me! O Heinrich, Heinrich, I have wronged you!
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">General.</span> No, Marya, you would have wronged me if you had not
carried your faith to its end. I—I—am the greatest anarchist of you all!
(<em>He dies. She looks at him a moment, puts her arms across her eyes, then
rises and speaks levelly to the servant who enters.</em>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">Marya.</span> Peter, I have killed your master. No, do not be afraid, I
shall sit here quietly. Lock me in, if you like, and send for the authorities.
(<em>The servant stands stupidly staring at her.</em>) Do as I say, at once!
(<em>He tumbles out. She sits slowly at her place, her elbows on the table, looking
dumbly into the distance.</em>)

<span class="firstchar">H</span><span class="postfirstchar">ow</span> do you do? Or, as Oscar Wilde preferred it, How do
you think? It is so much more interesting. Tell me, if you can, spontaneously,
freely, about your thoughts, reveal your personality, and we shall
enjoy a most engaging conversation, as charming as any good novel or essay.
Speak about yourself; people do this so much better than when they discuss
others. To me the most enchanting reading has always been literature
of Personality, such as subjective lyrics or chatty essays of the Montaigne
category; but I am particularly interested in Letters and Memoirs, where
the writer reaches transparency, unless he deliberately uses his pen as a
masque for self-concealment, as is the case, to my mind, in <em>De Profundis</em>.
True, an artist reveals his best in his artistic creation; you discover autobiographical
contours of Goethe in Faust and Werther; Tolstoy’s restless
searchings are mirrored in Besukhov, in Levin, in Nekhludov; Zarathustra
and <em>Ecce Homo</em> allow you a glimpse into the very crater of Vesuvius-Nietzsche.
Yet through this medium you see the artist in his royal garb,
so to speak, in his regalia; he seldom appears to you in his unceremonious
morning-gown and slippers, to let you contemplate him not at his <em>best</em> but
in his quotidian intimate aspect. Exceptions? I admit a legion.

<p>
To be sure, Francois Villon<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a> wore no stage array. His childish frankness
and spontaneity account for the fact that he is to this very day an outcast
among <em>bon ton</em> salons, and even Robert Louis Stevenson stooped to condemn
him. Of course he is a disgrace for the fraternity of writers: a thief,
a robber, a murderer, a tramp, a debauchee, who possessed less tact than
even his by-no-means puritanic confrère, Rabelais, and chanted most exquisite
verses on most base topics. Villon is not in the least detached from
his poetry: he is it, his very life was a song, a ballad. Filthy fifteenth century
Paris, licentious monks, mercenary courtesans, tavern sages, knights of
the road and candidates of the gibbet—in such an atmosphere the poet
breathed, lived, and sang in the old picturesque French. Every adventure,
every experience, impression, and emotion, Villon reflected in a ballad or a
rondel, with equal beauty and sincerity; with equal compassion and loyalty
he chanted to his religious mother and to the faded courtesan, to the duck-thief
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
and to the creaking gibbet; and he poured a world of tender humor
and sympathy into his greatest <em>Ballade des Pendus</em>, an epitaph for himself
and his companions expecting to be hanged. You may love him, you may
condemn him, but you cannot deny his absolute truthfulness, for his soul is
unreservedly denuded, a quivering, appealing, humane soul.

<p class="noindent">
Villon is justly called “the father of French poetry”; his influence
has been felt for nearly five centuries, from Rabelais to Verhaeren. Indeed,
in the savage cosmic rhythm of the “enormous” Belgian I often hear the
echo of the medieval “<em>Pauvre Villon</em>.” Verhaeren.... I must close my eyes
when I think of this Titan. You cannot gauge him, you cannot see him in
his entirety: an Atlas, bigger than our planet, detached from it. I think
Verhaeren has been best loved, and perhaps best understood in Russia,—a
land where realities are looked upon as symbols, else life would become
a horrible absurdity. There he is endeared as the lyricist of the modern
soul rent with eternal contradictions in the great task of transvaluation of
values: a mystic with no God, a prophet with no blessing, a positivist
without faith in man, a socialist without a political program, an
anarchist without “action,” an urbanite longing for his village, a villager
craving for the city. Verhaeren destroys rather than creates,
wills rather than believes, yearns rather than attains. His movement
lacks gracefulness; his attack, firmness; his flight, lightness; his love,
tenderness; his architecture is without system, his system without method.
And the more profound, the more palpitating and irresistible is the chaos of
his titanic images heaped in masses, the more sincere are his wails, the
more burning his tears. I think it was the admirable French critic, René
Ghil, who observed that to Verhaeren the world appears as if in a flash of
lightning, in an enormous, exaggerated form, and as such he embodies it
in his work—also exaggerated, also enormous; that his poetry resembles
the genius of Rodin hewing his Balzac out of marble and powerful dreams.
</p>

<p>
How differently is Verhaeren conceived in the Teutonic mind! The
Austrian poet, Stefan Zweig,<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-2" id="fnote-2">[2]</a> has written an interesting book on the Belgian,
an elaborate study of his personality and works, which substantiates
my claim that people speak much more successfully about themselves than
about others. Herr Zweig appreciates Verhaeren highly (and let me tell
you sub rosa, my friend, that his general estimation of the Poet is but a pale
echoing of the brilliant Léon Bazalgette in his book <em>Les célébrités d’aujourd
hui</em>); he considers him the greatest poet living, he names him <em>the</em> European
poet in the same sense as Whitman is <em>the</em> American poet. Soon, however,
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
he falls into the Teutonic fallacy of preciseness-by-all-means, of violently
accurate definitions which <em>must</em> suit the facts, else—<em>desto schlimmer für die
Fakten</em>. He wishes us to believe with him that Verhaeren is the poet of
socialism, of democracy, that he has proclaimed his great Aye to contemporary
life, with its greed, factories, and smoke; that a poet who wants “to
be necessary to our time must feel that everything in this time is necessary,
and therefore beautiful.” Thus with the German skill in fencing with
Hegelian dialectics the critic endeavors to persuade us that Verhaeren must
needs love modern life in all its aspects, that he is enraptured with all manifestations
of contemporary spirit, from the urban “multitude” to that most
hideous platitude, the Eiffel Tower. Mr. Zweig has utterly failed to see
that Verhaeren does not feel the present, the contemporary, that he lives
spiritually in the past and in the future, while the fleeting present is for
him but a <em>symbol</em>, an alphabet of monstrous hieroglyphs, the mysteries of
which he interprets prophetically. Has he not expressed his endless despair
and maddening grief over the tragedy of the all-absorbing monster-city?
Has the world not been to him a Golgotha, “an eternal illusion”? To Mr.
Zweig Verhaeren is a happy, satisfied lover of all and everything. The
poet and the painter, Maximilian Voloshin (one of whose poems appeared
in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>), relates his impression of the Belgian: “When you
see him for the first time you notice before anything else a deep furrow
cleaving his brow, resembling two wide-spread wings of a flying bird.
This furrow is himself. In it is his sorrow, his flight.” I wonder
whether Mr. Zweig has observed the furrow; or did he deliberately overlook
it in order to save his “structure”?

Yes, my friend, people seldom succeed in their attempt to interpret
others. Would you classify biographies as literature of personality?
Perhaps in the sense that they reveal the personality of the biographer,
but then it depends upon the value of that personality. Here is an instance.
The brother of Parnell writes his Memoirs<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-3" id="fnote-3">[3]</a>, bringing forth a
mass of details and anecdotes of “Charley’s” life. Charles Parnell has
always been a fascinating personality to me. Long ago I heard a lecturer
speaking on the great Irishman before a European audience of
revolutionists; the listeners (by no means Irish!) were enchanted with
the figure of the unique leader, with his powerful individuality and skillful
strategy. I have pondered many a time over his portrait revealing
the mysterious face of a medieval sorcerer, and have looked forward to
a work that would help me in gaining a clearer idea of the “uncrowned
King of Ireland.” His brother’s memoirs gave me a wealth of information
about their family pedigree and about each individual member
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
(their number is considerable), particularly about the writer’s business
undertakings. About Charles Parnell I have learned numerous external
facts and figures, but his intrinsic self is as little known to me now as
before. Of what value is such a book which succeeds merely in introducing
to you Mr. John Howard, an Irish gentleman of no particular
interest?

<p>
It is totally different when you are confronted with such a wonderful
individuality as Romain Rolland<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-4" id="fnote-4">[4]</a>. Apparently it is a book of essays
on Berlioz, Wagner, Saint-Saëns, D’Indy, Strauss, Debussy, and on some
aspects of modern music; in reality you come to know the rich personality
of Rolland and the reactions of his sensitive, graceful soul on the
musical productions of our best-known composers. I am delighted with
his influence on my views; not that he has altered them: musical opinions
do not let themselves be proved or disproved; but he has <em>enhanced</em>
my attitudes, he has made me admire my favorites more profoundly and
hate my torturers more thoroughly. Do not let your Editor know that
Brahms’s symphonies prove as indigestible to Rolland as they have been
to your humble Incurable. It is the reading of such a book that offers
me the joy of looking into a great soul, and it reminds me of the exalted
experience I have had in reading Wilde’s <em>Intentions</em>, or the essays of
Przybyszewsky and Arthur Symons.
</p>

<p>
The unceremonious self-revealment of a great man, of which I spoke
in the beginning, does not always appeal to my aesthetic sense. At
times my feeling of delicacy is scalded at the sight of a repulsive
negligee. It has painfully irritated me to read Dostoevsky’s letters<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-5" id="fnote-5">[5]</a>
in the English translation: would that the Russians kept their dirty
linen at home. The book reveals a petty tragedy of a great personality;
eternal want, indebtedness, whimpering, small jealousy, narrowness, intolerance.
We learn how most of his books were written in a hurry,
under pressure of need, the author being aware of their inadequacy; we
learn of his petty envy towards Turgeniev, his slighting of Tolstoy, his
bigoted hatred of everything liberal, European, his sturdy opposition to
the revolutionists, his obsequious demeanor before high officials. With
the exception of a few bright spots, the pages produce the nauseating
effect of a pathological museum. Such a pity.

A Note on Paroxysm in Poetry
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Edward J. O’Brien</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">P</span><span class="postfirstchar">aroxysm</span> is the poetic expression of that modern spirit which finds
its most notable expression in other arts in the sculpture of Meunier,
the polyphonic music of Strauss, the philosophy of Bergson, and the
American skyscraper. It is the application of dynamics to poetry. It
stands midway between romanticism, which is an escape into the past,
and futurism, which is a flight into the future. Paroxysm is deep-rooted
in to-day.
</p>

<p>
M. Nicolas Beauduin, its most noteworthy French exemplar, has
many noteworthy disciples in France and Germany, and paroxysm is a
well-known force in every literature except that of America, where its
unconscious expression in life has been most remarkable. Students will
find its philosophy set forth and its current phases in literature duly
chronicled in M. Beauduin’s quarterly review, <em>La Vie des Lettres</em>. It is
only possible here to offer a few very brief hints as to its literary aims
and materials:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
It aims to be a synthesis of modern industrial and mechanical effort.
</p>

<p>
It repudiates the ivory tower.
</p>

<p>
It handles the materials of modern life directly, not in symbols.
</p>

<p>
It responds to the roar of factories and trains.
</p>

<p>
The poet is to be “an active lyric,” representing his age.
</p>

<p>
The poet’s vision is the cinematograph of modern life with its continual mechanical
transfiguration.
</p>

<p>
It is not sentimental.
</p>

<p>
To art for art’s sake, and art for truth’s sake, it opposes art for life’s sake.
</p>

<p>
It discards personal sensation; it is not ashamed to be “cosmic.”
</p>

<p>
The evolution of poetry is to be as rapid and terrible henceforth as material
evolution.
</p>

<p>
It will sing the new man, the man-machine, the multiplied man, the Man-Bird.
</p>

<p>
It exalts motion and repudiates equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
It is social.
</p>

<p>
It feels the need for violent motives of faith, and finds them in the passion of the
cities.
</p>

<p>
It cultivates a scientific technique.
</p>

<p>
It does not reject any words in forming a vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
It seeks swift, hurtling, dynamic rhythms.
</p>

<p>
It is based on “dynamic notions of qualitative duration, of heterogeneous continuity,
of multiple and mobile states of consciousness.”
</p>

<p>
It perceives the elements of poetry contained in modern cities, locomotives, aëroplanes,
dreadnoughts, and submarines; in a stock exchange, a Wall Street, or a wheat
pit; and in every scientific marvel and in the sonorous song of factories and railways.
</p>

<p>
It emphasizes their dynamic consciousness.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
<a id="page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"></a>
To sum up: It aims to attain and express with the quick, keen
vigor and strength of steel, the whirling, audacious, burning life of our
epoch in all the paroxysm of the New Beauty.
</p>

<p>
When M. Beauduin’s new volume, <em>La Cité des Hommes</em>, is translated
and published in America, it will be less difficult to estimate the
success with which paroxyst poetry may be achieved.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar"><span class="prefirstchar">“‘</span>A</span> flower is beautiful,’ we say—but why? Because in its geometry
and its sensuous qualities it is an embodiment and significant expression
of that precious something in ourselves which we instinctively know to
be Life, ‘an eye looking out upon us from the great inner sea of beauty,’
a proof of the eternal harmony in the nature of a universe which is too
vast and intimate and real for the mere intellect to grasp.”
</p>

<p>
Yet our materialists would solve the Problem with their material
intellects. And our theologians would solve it with their ecclesiastical
deductions. The one would put Life in the cold hands of the scientist,
expert in fact and figure; the other, gropingly indefinite, in the hands
<a id="page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"></a>
of the spiritual <a id="corr-5"></a>formulaist. Yet both are wrong. The Problem can be
solved. The literal, objective guesses of the materialist are but flimsy
realisms far from true. The indefinite, abstract dreams of the theologian
are but the futile inaptitudes of man calculated to define that which
cannot be defined.
</p>

<p>
But definitions are not what the world needs. The Solution would
be interesting, but the Problem is fascinating. It is the Going and not
the Goal that holds us to the bitter and the sweet, through mornings,
noons, and nights, year by year.
</p>

<p>
If, then, we grant the Solution but a cold conclusion, and the Goal
but a stagnation point, to whom can we turn but to the artists—those
spiritual children of that great master who wept when he could find no
imperfection in his masterpiece.

Written philosophies of artist craftsmen are rare. Their busy lives
find little time for penning rules; but when one does speak, it is with
the captivating force of original thought: the summary of attainments
through many trials and many failures.
</p>

<p>
And it is with this sure touch of deep artistic experience that Frank
Lloyd Wright draws from the geometric beauty of the mystic Japanese
prints his philosophy of the artist as master of the Problem.
</p>

<p>
“Real civilization means for us a right conventionalizing of our
original state of nature, just such a conventionalizing as the true artist
imposes on <a id="corr-6"></a>natural forms. The law-giver and reformer of social customs
must have, however, the artist soul, the artist eye in directing this
process, if the light of the race is not to go out. So, art is not alone
the expression, but in turn the great conservator and transmitter of the
finer sensibilities of a people. More still, it is to show those who shall
understand just where and how we shall bring coercion to bear upon
the material of human conduct. So the indigenous art of a people is
their only prophecy and their school of anointed prophets and kings.
Our own art is the only light by which this conventionalizing process
we call “civilization” may eventually make its institutions harmonious
with the fairest conditions of our individual and social life.
</p>

<p>
“I wish I might use another word than ‘conventionalizing’ to convey
the notion of this magic process of the artist mind, which is the
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
constant haunting reference of this paper, because it is the perpetual,
insistent suggestion of this particular art we have discussed. Only an
artist, or one with genuine artistic training, is likely, I fear, to realize
precisely what the word as here used connotes. Let me illustrate once
more. To know a thing (what we can really call knowing), a man must
first love the thing and sympathize vividly with it. Egypt thus knew
the lotus, and translated the flower to the dignified stone forms of her
architecture. Thus was the lotus conventionalized. Greece knew and
idealized the acanthus in stone translations. Thus was the acanthus
conventionalized. If Egypt or Greece had plucked the flowers as they
grew, and given us a mere imitation of them in stone, the stone forms
would have died with the original. In translating, however, its very
life’s principle into terms of stone well adapted to grace a column capital,
the Egyptian artist made it pass through a rarifying spiritual
process, whereby its natural character was really intensified and revealed
in terms of stone adapted to an architectural use. The lotus gained thus
imperishable significance; for the life-principle in the flower is translated—transmuted
to terms of building stone to idealize a real need.
This is conventionalization. It is reality because it is poetry. As the
Egyptian took the lotus, the Greek the acanthus, and the Japanese every
natural thing on earth, as we may take and adapt to our highest use
in our own way a natural flower or thing, so civilization must take the
natural man, to fit him for his place in this great piece of architecture
we call the social state. And today, as centuries ago, it is the prophetic
artist mind that must reveal this natural state idealized, conventionalized
harmoniously with the life-principle of all men. How otherwise shall it
be discerned? All the sheer wisdom of science, the cunning of politics
and the prayers of religion can but stand and wait for the revelation,—awaiting
at the hands of the artist that conventionalization of the free
expression of life-principle which shall make our social living beautiful,—organically
true. Behind all institutions or dogmatic schemes,
whatever their worth may be, or their venerable antiquity,—behind
them all is something produced and preserved for its aesthetic worth;
the song of the poet, some artist vision, the pattern seen in the mount.
</p>

<p>
“Now speaking a language all the clearer because not native to us,
beggared as we are by material riches, the humble Japanese artist has
become greatly significant because he is the interpreter of the one permanent
thing in the life of his people; that one permanent thing being
the principle of a right conventionalization of life which makes of their
native forms the most humanly significant, and most humanly joy-giving
as in its ever varied moods and in evanescent loveliness he has made
Fujiyama—that image of man in the vast—the God of Nippon.”

If we must have censorship, the Major’s is as good as any.
</p>

<p>
Censorship with flaws is preferable to perfect censorship because
perfect censorship would abolish the necessity of one’s judgment.
</p>

<p>
Imperfect censorship permits us, by its slips, to exercise our minds.
</p>

<p>
In no other civilized country is there such restriction.
</p>

<p>
Artists in America must keep their keenest visions to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Censorship deadens human perceptions.
</p>

<p>
Who wants cloistered virtues when true health is possible?
</p>

<p>
Man must learn to judge for himself; and he surely will do so.

America is unprecedented in its timidity of tastes and convictions.

<p>
It isn’t a question of arbitrary standard; it’s purely aesthetic.
</p>

<p>
The Major passes films of the most flagrant sentimentality.
</p>

<p>
Only legal restrictions are made, and these are futile.
</p>

<p>
The only satisfactory standard is that of individual taste.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the title of this debate was not quite the one used on
this article. It was very tame—the title. But not so with the films.
The Major had evidently selected his choicest ones—and a goodly number
of these—which were reeled off in swift succession. Murder trod
on the heels of love. Flaming moments of lust were split up by stage-robbers.
Nigger babies, whose crime was that they didn’t need clothes,
followed suicides.
</p>

<p>
Your reporter was fortunate enough to find an acquaintance, sitting
in the rear of the hall. This lady married a man of millions. He liked
the way she did <em>Florodora</em>—liked it so well that he gave her a chance,
which she has since made much of. She is charming, because she has
retained the frankness of the stage and merely exchanged the shoddy
furs and diamonds for the real thing. She confided that <em>The Follies</em>
were simply right, and that the Drama League was radically opposed to
the movies in any or all forms, and that she adored winter because it
kept reminding her of Christmas. She is a supporting member of the
League, and the only one present who waived her constitutional prerogative
of a front seat. Her sisters-in-league were availing themselves
of their privilege. They wanted to be where they could not get out, in
case the pictures were really good.
</p>

<p>
And they were—sickening. Not a member left. Not a whisper.
All eyes focused upon the screen, where horrors of war and of love (in
which there seemed to be nothing fair) were showing. When their
nervous systems could stand no more, some lady’s locomotive and oral
powers returned, and the reel was stopped.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"></a>
Then came Mr. Cary, who found it difficult not to speak over their
heads with his simple language and big ideas. The audience whispered
and began to show the tips of countless yellow-feathers. They could
stand horrible pictures; but this talk was too much. It was too sane
and calm and cutting. Yellow feathers showed, full length. Women left
in twos and threes, although the first person to go out was a male.
Cary’s short, admirable paragraphs were divided in this manner:—three
ladies on the right of the hall would balance their departure under cover,
as it were, of the departure of three sisters on the left. This mental
cowardice was worse than the pictures.
</p>

<p>
An intolerable discussion followed. A huge wave of ancient yet
ever-modern philistinism raised itself among the majority of those who
remained, and surged across the hall to drown Mr. Cary and Mrs. Henderson.
Major Funkhouser found his feet again, and assumed the big-brother-protector
attitude, to repeated grand-stand advantages. As long
as they had seen the pictures, what matter if the public didn’t? Evolution
lost the day. Stagnation was an immediate success. Your reporter
left, grinning.

</p>

<p>
In times most ancient—at culture’s dawn of day—the individual was
swallowed up and lost in the life of the tribe. He did not count as an
individual, but was valued only as a member of the group to which he
happened to belong. Subsequently, man’s endowment to personality
entered upon its unfolding—the first syllables of the long human story
were stammered. Man began to become a self. To be a self was to
specialize into a difference from all other men. From that moment on,
the entire course of evolution may be considered as a progressive differentiation
and specialization of the human personality. At the outset
there were only a few splendidly and highly endowed natures that felt
a distinct life of their own welling up in themselves from mysterious
springs of being. They took up the gauge of battle against others,
against the mass which attempted to subject and assimilate them to its
peculiarity. Mass meant monotony. But the differentiating energy
and impetus encroached further and further, passing from the great to
the small, pushing into the mass whose members no longer wanted
to be mass, herd, but men. The might of spiritual personality opposed
itself to the superiority of corporeal peculiarity. Psychical feeling more
and more became personal. Character increasingly received a distinctive
stamp. Along with this, the impulse to self-dependence began
to stir even in those men who were outclassed in physical strength by
their stronger human brothers. Later, when the head and heart, and
no longer the fist, formed the strength of man, woman pressed into the
circle of life’s evolution. She was no longer a mere exemplar of the
genius. She, too, would be personality. This course of events signified
an infinite refinement and enrichment of cultural life on the one side;
on the other, it gave rise to the question as to how, in this differentiation
of men into even more decidedly pronounced personalities, a cohesiveness
could be originated among them that would save life from
disintegration and consequent decay. At bottom, the individual is not
sufficient unto himself. Self-dependent, he would be miserably impoverished
and stunted—of this there can be no doubt, according to the most
elementary laws of life. Hence, along with the formation of human
personality, there is a refinement of those forces of life which seem summoned
to secure a bond of fellowship among men: law, custom, a
benevolent disposition toward others, the feeling of sympathy for others.
Even Nietzsche, who foresees a future in which all these older group
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
forces and moral impulses shall be obliterated, and every man pander
to his own self alone and his own peculiarity in willing and feeling, in
thinking and speaking—even Nietzsche cannot help preaching a new love
that shall bind men together. Even Zarathustra confesses: “I love men!
My will, my ardent will to creation, impels me constantly to men—as
the hammer to the stone!” To be sure, this Zarathustra-love is to grow
out beyond and above what we call love to-day, what we call Christian
love. There is to be a Beyond Christianity. The new love will be as
high above the old love as Above-Man will be above man. Beyond-man
means Beyond-love. How earnestly and ominously does this preaching
of a new love pierce like a sword into the heart of our time! A new test
of the worth or unworth of our moral view of life! Were we even convinced
that the best and purest features of the old Christian love would
re-appear in any new love, still the question would not be elucidated—the
question whether this old love would thereby become new again,
would become living again, save through a storm of thunder and lightning
that should purify the heavy, stuffy atmosphere which has gathered
about the word love itself.
</p>

<p>
You will know them by their fruits—of nothing is this so true as
of love. Where there is power, an effect must ensue, and in the effect,
not only the right of the power, but the kind as well, manifests itself.
Now, love wills to promote the life of another with its own life. Love
wills to do good to its object, to redress some wrong, supply some lack, help
some need, remedy some defect, and the like. Therefore, the fruits of
love are gifts—hence, <em>die schenkende Tugend</em>, the bestowing or the giving
virtue, of Nietzsche’s phrase. Accordingly, only a possessor can give.
Who possesses most—the rich—give most! Who needs gifts is poor, and
since poverty is great, becoming ever greater, gifts are needed to meet
the needs. Thus, human love has become the practice of beneficence—the
work of the rich by which they help the poor. The greatness of benefactions,
this becomes a criterion for the greatness of love. We have but
to think of the “foundations” and “benevolent funds” and “charitable institutions”
and “unions” for the care and keeping of the poor, as well as of
the incalculable sums which are given in private for the relief of want,
in order to be impressed with the “fruits” which have grown on the
tree of human love. How magnificent, how imposing these “fruits” are!
How much love there is in the world today, in this world in which so
much good is done! Who could doubt it? Who could deny it? Who?
Who but Friedrich Nietzsche!
</p>

<p>
The loathsome vanity and the refined hypocrisy with which this
beneficence is prosecuted, such obvious strictures as these, Nietzsche
passes over without a word. This genus “benefactor” that does what
it does just to benefit itself, is so lowdown to the Zarathustra-poet that
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
he will not honor it with a notice. He simply classed it with the gilded
and counterfeit rabble, <em>Pöbel</em>, with the culprits of wealth, who pick their
profits from sweepings. Then there is the criterion of the numerical
worth of the gift, not the ratio of the gift to the possessions of the giver,
this criterion for the evaluation of love was so external, so deceptive, to
Nietzsche, that he left it, too, out of account. What impelled Nietzsche
to his depreciation of this whole species of beneficence was something
different, something deeper. All these gifts, great and numerical as they
may be, are alms, and who has only alms to give to man is a poor man,
and Zarathustra feels—well, listen to what he says to the saint!
</p>

<p>
Zarathustra answered: “I love men.”
</p>

<p>
“Why,” said the saint, “did I go to the forest and desert? Was
it not because I loved men greatly over-much? Now I love God: men
I love not. Man is a thing far too imperfect for me. Love of men
would kill me.”
</p>

<p>
Zarathustra answered: “What did I say of love! I am bringing
gifts to men.”
</p>

<p>
“Do not give them anything,” said the saint. “Rather take something
from them and bear their burdens along with them—that will
serve them best; if it only serve thyself well! And if thou art going
to give them aught, give them no more than an alms, and let them
beg even for that.”
</p>

<p>
“No,” said Zarathustra, “I do not give alms. I am not poor enough
for that.”
</p>

<p>
<em>I am not poor enough for that.</em> Priceless words! You read these
words and you think of truly kindhearted men who sigh: If I were
only rich so I could do good! They envy the rich their possessions,
not for the sake of the pleasures and comforts which possessions permit
their possessors to provide, but in the wholly honest feeling of the blessings
which they could scatter with their wealth. Then comes Nietzsche,
and says to these kindhearted men, You are only poor noodles, if you
have nothing better to bring the world and men than this blessing of
wealth. Then he points them to gifts the least of which outweighs a
million donations.
</p>

<p>
Now, Nietzsche had no contempt of wealth with which to insult
his fellowmen’s intelligence. Nor was he a socialistic indicter of beneficence.
Nor was he even a rigorous critic of the doubtful disposition,
so often manifest in such benevolent activities. But perhaps his plain
words on the poverty of almsgiving seem so weighty precisely because
he must be acquitted without further ado of speaking from contempt,
from the standpoint of Christianity, or from the milieu of poor folk. And
yet it was this most soaring spirit of the nineteenth century, this aristocrat
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
from top to toe, compared with whom even a Goethe seems like a
plebeian, it was precisely he who—as from an aerie up among the
eagles—looked down with such abysmal contempt upon the highest
and noblest triumph of riches—namely, the ability to bestow benefits—that
he detected, even in this triumph, only testimony to the poverty
of riches. Along with this, at all events, Nietzsche passed damnatory
judgment upon a <em>Kultur</em> which estimates the distances among men, the
measure of their greatness according to the distinctions of possession,
and therefore derives the right of the influence which it accords the
individual from the sums which he donates by way of alms. Then, too,
what has the man to do with his possession! It is not his <em>personality</em>
which has assigned him a place in life where a confluence of industrial
goods crystallize around him! What does it signify as to the worth
of a man that he has cast his baited hook into the stream of life just
where a big hungry fish swims by and bites! And if, now, this most
contingent of all contingencies, that a man should get rich, is considered
by his generation as the peculiar deed of a hero, the deed which
he was in a position to compass in life,—if the mere fact that a man
releases, in the shape of benefits and alms, a part of this wealth which
he could not spend upon himself if he would is a phenomenon around
which the conversation of the day revolves, of which newspapers in
special articles and telegraphic dispatches have so much to say, then
this is a sign of the decay of our moral culture, and we cannot be thankful
enough to the man who has jolted us out of such aberration of ideas
and made us see with eyes no longer blinded by the glitter of gold!
</p>

<p>
Aye, wealth a man does need who wants to give. Wealth he needs
for the sake of his giving love. But he must create this wealth himself.
He must wrest wealth from all values. He must coerce all things to
himself and into himself. All these things must stream back from the
well of living water within him as the gifts of his love. Insatiably does
the soul seek after treasures and gems because her virtue is insatiable
in her will to give. This is the soul’s thirst to be an offering and a gift,
and hence she thirsts to house all wealth in herself.
</p>

<p>
Vulgar souls give what they have, noble souls what they are—this
is the well known saying that mirrors the meaning of Nietzsche. Love’s
highest labor is to create something great out of its ownself, that it
may be able to give unceasingly out of its own fulness and yet never
be exhausted! No mountain is too steep and no valley too deep for
love, because love herself must know heights and depths that she may
give to others what she has seen and known there. Do we fear lest
we succumb to a weakness? Then we must force the weakness underneath
our feet because we need our strength to give strength to others.
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
Would we say to virtue: Thou art too hard for us; take thy laurel
and let us sin? Now, the hardest is spur to our love, to steel our wills,
our courage, so that courage may gush into the souls of others also.
What we have made out of our own selves, this, this alone, is our
wealth, this is the gift by whose bestowal men can become rich. A
thought of our own which we have acquired; a light of our own, which
we have kindled in our innermost being; a lofty enthusiasm for what
is great; an energetic aversion to all that is common and base,—this
is our true wealth, the gift that enriches us while it is given to others.
Poor indeed are the people who can give only alms; rich indeed are
those who give themselves to men, who proffer their most intimate gifts
to men, who say to men’s hidden hearts and hopes: Silver and gold
have I none, but such as I have, I give unto thee!
</p>

<p>
Why are we so deeply involved in hard necessity that our life can
not dispense with alms and therefore with the people who make a
virtue out of this giving of alms! Simply because we have so few such
truly rich men who thirst to become offerings and gifts for man! These
men can we have, can we become ourselves, only when duty and righteousness,
and not benevolence and inclination, shall decide in an ordering
and helpful way, as to the requirement of life. Behind every benefit
which is necessary there is concealed an unrighteousness of life which
makes the benefit necessary. All alms with which the world cannot dispense
today is an accusation against our culture, a confession of how
poor we are in the midst of all our wealth. It will be the first great step
towards a new culture when we first learn to measure the unworth of
these benefits by the eternal worths which alone are worthy of man,
which man forms in himself as new fructifying deeds, as the lightning
of thought which detonates from his soul, as living beauty to which he
gives shape in his own being.
</p>

<p>
Then if all duties which are based on right and law, shall cease to
be considered as something special, something great, if their fulfilment
shall be no longer marveled at as a feat of virtue, because these duties
shall have become self-evident and natural, then shall man be illumined
by new and greater duties which shall make him a debtor to life, then
shall he call his wealth and the fulness of his being his debt which
he can pay only in constant creation for man, in ceaseless giving to man!
“Therefore, nobler souls will it: they will to have nothing <em>gratis</em>, least
of all life! Whoever is of the <em>Pöbel</em> wills to live <em>gratis</em>, but we others
to whom life gave itself—we ever meditate as to what we can best
give in return and, verily, that is a noble saying which says: what life
promises us, that will we keep for life!” In simpler language: Not to
merit a reward, heavenly or earthly, will we give, will we assemble
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
in ourselves the highest gifts, to lay them down as offerings upon the
altars of men, but we will give to return thanks for all that we have
undeservedly received. Bickering and calculating as to whether we have
had our just dues, haggling over hopes which have not done what they
promised, we will have none of this, but thanks, thanks, that as men
we have gained some material from the saddest life, created joys out
of its pains, wealth and worth out of its weakness and loss. This, this,
in Nietzsche’s immortal words, is <em>eine Umwertung der Werte</em>, a transvaluation
of values in the moral life, from which a new moral culture can
issue. In our labors we are ever shadowed by the still, lurking thought
of returns and rewards, we calculate, and calculate ever in our own
favor, that somewhere life has left us in the lurch. Could we but
once reverse this matter: It is not life that is obligated and indebted
to us—we are obligated and indebted to life! In the former way of
counting we always come out with a deficit, with a poverty: in the
later, with a balance, with a wealth: we still have something for which
we gave nothing, did nothing, with which we have done no good!
</p>

<p>
How would it do to put such thankfulness to the test? When the
heart is shaken with sorrow’s power—it is life’s gift to feel such shaking,
in such shaking love can feel the storm raging. Even such gift you would
not have <em>gratis</em>. You would make some return—the bravery with which
you settle for it. You come to know despondency, a new deed, and your
thanks therefor is that you have been permitted to overcome a paralysis
of your energy. If, with freer vision and with broader heart, your eye has
become alert and keen for human folly and lamentation, and these attack
you as cowardice and disgust of life, then you take this as a gift that
you will not have <em>gratis</em>, you will give something as counter-gift and
thanks: a more energetic will, that will go to the bottom of folly and
grief, with the fineness of feeling which has been bestowed upon you—you
will dig deeper, search out more earnestly the genuine values of life, so that
your cowardice and your <em>ennui</em> at life may become a new strength and a
new joy for life. If you feel your hands tied, if the world seems a prison
at whose bars you lunge, but whose rods you cannot break, if then a horrible
feebleness befalls you, and your best will confesses that you are too
weak,—then take this, too, as a gift for which you learn to give thanks,
for even the restriction of your power creates a new freedom, the pressure
of the impossible ceases with your learning, thus, the possible, the necessary,
of your life. Poor? You may be rich, immeasurably rich, not for yourself
indeed, but for others, that you may communicate to them, give to them
and yet never give out! Be debtor of life, that in your poverty you may
make many rich. Be debtor of love, that you may never be able to pay your
great eternal debt. Confessing and obligating yourself to such debt, your
life gains that eternal worth which increases the more you spend of it, which
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
receives, the more you give of it. Poor, yet having all things; poor, yet
making many rich—<em>also sprach Paulus-Nietzsche</em>.
</p>

<p>
After this Zarathustra went back into the mountains and the solitude
of his <a id="corr-11"></a>cave and withdrew from men, waiting like a sower who hath thrown
out his seed. But his soul was filled with impatience and longing for those
he loved; for he had still many gifts for them. For this is the hardest:
to shut one’s open hand because of love.

It is the business of the very few to be independent: it is the privilege of the
strong, and whoever attempts it, even with the best regret but without being obliged
to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure.
He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousand-fold the dangers which life itself
already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he
loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some <a id="corr-12"></a>minotaur of conscience.
Supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men
that they can neither feel it nor sympathize with it, and he cannot any longer go back!
He cannot ever go back again to the sympathies of men.—<em>Nietzsche.</em>

<h3 class="section" id="MRS_HAVELOCK_ELLIS">
<em>Mrs. Havelock Ellis</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">M</span><span class="postfirstchar">rs.</span> Ellis’s visit to Chicago has been a series of revelations.
At first she was a little disappointing: in her lecture
on James Hinton and his sex ethics—particularly in the
discussion which followed it—Mrs. Ellis did not loom as large as
some of her more “destructive” contemporaries. The thing was
beautifully done, of course—a gorgeous bit of interpretative art;
for Mrs. Ellis chooses words with a poet’s care and presents
ideas with an economy that is invigorating and restful at the
same time. But in so far as the lecture reflected her own ideas
it had some of the limitations to which the eugenist point of
view is always open: the failure to go quite the whole distance.
Compared with the directness and honest thoroughness of the
few pioneers who are advocating birth control—like Margaret
Sanger, whose little pamphlet on the subject will cost her ten
years imprisonment if the authorities can get hold of her—the
ideas of Mrs. Ellis came with a certain inadequacy. But later
she cleared herself of the charge of cultism by her laughing
remark to some one who discussed eugenics with her: “Eugenics?
A mere spoke in the wheel, and a very dogmatic spoke at
that. Heaven knows we don’t want a race of averages.” One
of her most delightful afternoons was given over to her Cornish
stories. She read one called <em>The Idealist</em>, which ought to be
studied by all those who draw their rigid distinctions between
“normal” and “abnormal”. As Mrs. Ellis said, “This story is an
attempt to show that those people we so piously consider the
worst of us are sometimes the best of us.” And so this charming
woman with her simplicity, her humor, her frankness, her idealism,
and her fine boyishness is a personality one must not fail to
know. She returns to Chicago on February 4, to lecture on sex
and eugenics in Orchestra Hall. That lecture will be given exclusively
to women and will include a discussion of sex abnormalities,
as well as a paper on the subject written especially for
the occasion by her husband, which Mrs. Ellis will read.

<em>A Journal of Ideas</em>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> New Republic is the first weekly in America which
has dared to assert that ideas are interesting, even if they
are new. We have had one kind of weekly whose main purpose
is to pay dividends to its owners. Dividends demand advertising,
advertising demands large circulation, circulation demands
pleasing as many people as possible, pleasing many people has
seemed to demand piffle and dishonesty. We have had another
kind of weekly which confines itself to academic criticism and
frankly gives up any attempt to speak to the nation. <em>The New
Republic</em> is run neither for dividends nor for ancient prestige. It
proceeds on the assumption that we can find writers who are
both honest enough and intelligent enough to speak things of a
value not determined either by capital or by the mob. It hopes
that their product may be so interesting that the people who
want to read it will be sufficiently numerous to support the
paper. It hopes vastly more that the ideas and opinions so
enunciated will introduce a powerful and much-needed element
of disinterested intelligence into American public life. The way
in which these hopes are put into print will have much to do
with the success of the attempt. But it is hopeful that somebody
with adequate resources and equipment is actually engaged in the
attempt to relate honesty and intelligence with the democracy.

Chicago Little Theatre for his lectures during January and
February a great many people ought to fall under the spell of
this man whose methods spoil one for almost all other lectures.
Mr. Powys’s intellect has that emotional character which is
likely to be the quality of the man of genius rather than the man
of talent. He might be called the arch-appreciator: he relies
upon the inspiration of the moment, and when violently enthusiastic
or violently the reverse (he is usually one of the two) he
never stops with less than ten superbly-chosen adjectives to express
his emotion exactly. His subjects will be Dostoevsky,
Wilde, Milton, Lamb, Hardy, Henry James, Dante, Rabelais,
Hugo, Verlaine, Goethe, and Heine. The dates may be had at
the Little Theatre.

Tomorrow”

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">O</span><span class="postfirstchar">ne’s</span> sense of the general or the particular fitness of things is disturbed
when an attempt is made to paraphrase or condense the
spoken words of Mrs. Ellis. It is seldom that this sense of fitness is at
all troubled, because it is a simple matter to extract from the average
lecture enough coherent material for second-hand purposes. On the
subject given above Mrs. Ellis compels continuous attention. It is not
enough to say that she steadily advances her ideas by means of careful
phrases, for every phrase seems to be an idea in itself. She is an artist.
Her words are like so many focussed lights, not one of which is superfluous.
And the illumination which she obtains is a grateful brightness.
In listening to her one’s powers of receptivity, while never strained, are
not for one moment allowed to rest. As she says, “It’s all solid meat.”
Hence, the feeling of futility in an attempt to present justly her observations
and schemes of social betterment.
</p>

<p>
What an absurdity might be suggested to the reader by the statement
that Mrs. Ellis advocates a form of “trial marriage” or a “probation
for engaged lovers”! And yet her plan of such a pre-ceremonial
arrangement is as practical as it is badly needed—practical and entirely
reasonable, in that she has apparently overlooked nothing, from the
subtleties of human nature to the future laws of the land. And how faddish
might she appear if one told of her attacks upon latter-day Puritanism,
lust in the guise of love, prostitution within marriage, the evils of
both repression and brutish or premature expression, the abomination
of smirking elders and cowardly guardians, and so forth. Truly, these
things constitute a fad of today, but—Mrs. Havelock Ellis was writing
and preaching these ideas longer than twenty-five years ago. In questions
of love, marriage, and the possible beauty of human relations, she
is a splendid, unhurrying pioneer. It would be impossible to measure
the courage, the fine perseverance, it has taken to work on patiently and
forcefully in the midst of leering society, infallible misunderstanding,
and a great ocean of evil-mindedness. What daring! to speak plainly
of the beauty of love-passion. And how hopeless! Here, evolution
endlessly proves itself a laggard process.
</p>

<p>
Until one hears Mrs. Ellis it is easy to overestimate the “building”
powers of Emma Goldman, although it is always too easy to consider
only Miss Goldman’s sturdy “wrecking” capacity. But the percentage
of constructive element in Mrs. Ellis’s work is much more apparent than
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
in Miss Goldman’s. Clearly, each woman is superlative in her own
sphere. By virtue of its tested strength, Mrs. Ellis’s constructive machinery
may be said to destroy naturally whatever gets in its way.
And in addition to this she does some direct, incisive battling as well.
Her humor has carbolic in it. Her sarcasm is a spiritual antiseptic.
</p>

<p>
In the realm of the child, Mrs. Ellis agrees with that grand Swedish
woman—Ellen Key. These two coincide upon the supreme importance
of full and proper education for the coming generation, including eugenics,
hygiene, and kindred topics. It is a joy to know of so much sanity
abroad in the world.
</p>

<p>
But even today, when a number of more or less important writers
and speakers are taking up her ideas, when Chicago is having the
truths of humanity forced down its tonsilitic throat, it was still possible—on
a Sunday night in the Little Theatre—for Mrs. Ellis to have in
her audience many whose deep sighs of boredom it was scarcely necessary
to observe before tagging them as a lower class of mentality, while
no doubt their jewels and furs were quite necessary to indicate their
social standing. What curious gropings of psychology brought these
people to such a lecture? Or was it fashion? In the faces of these
might a dozen Saviours have found ample pity-material. Yawns and
dull looks! Something between a Cross and a Bomb was wanting to
awaken these unthinking ones, asleep while superb ideas—ideas of
admirable vitality and development—were being put before them by
the clear and earnest voice of a great woman.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> have to humiliate myself at the beginning of this letter. Nietzsche
did not provoke the war; he did not imagine there was ever any
specifically “Teutonic” culture, worthy of being spread at any cost;
and he seems to have disliked Prussia as much or more than I do. I
say this not to inform the readers of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, who know it
all already from the number in which my error appeared, but to unburden
my soul. I sinned like a daily journalist and spoke from hearsay—for
I confess I have never been able to read Nietzsche with sufficient
attention to gain more than a vague notion of his ideas. Two persons
set me right—Mr. Harold Monro, the editor of <em>Poetry and Drama</em>, with
some heat and indignation, and, more gently, Mr. A. R. Orage, the
editor of <em>The New Age</em>, who was in old days one of the first to bring
Nietzsche to England. It would seem that his efforts were of little use,
for my blunder was merely an incident in a carnival of misapprehension
which is now engaging our pseudo-intellectual critics. I have sinned in
numerous, if evil, company.
</p>

<p>
I must withdraw another statement—namely, that the war has
produced no adequate and agreeable verse. Mr. Maurice Hewlett’s
<em>Sing-songs of the War</em> (published by the Poetry Bookshop) is an admirable
little volume. Wisely pitching his note neither too high nor too
vulgarly, he has struck closer to the mark than he has ever in any
attempt. He has achieved an excellent patriotic song, beginning

<p class="noindent">
That needs only supporting music to be a fine song of the pleasant
boisterousness and exaggeration that it should be. Of the others,
<em>The Drowned Sailor</em> and <em>Soldier, Soldier</em>, have caught a wonderful and
touching note of the folk-song. Mr. Hewlett’s work here is not ambitious,
he has profited enormously by not keeping in his mind the
necessity of producing a fine piece of literature. He has tried honestly
to produce “something that will do” and much good poetry has been
written in that way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Harold Monro’s new book, <em>Children of Love</em>, which he has published
himself at the Poetry Bookshop, contains also four gloomy war poems
as far removed from Mr. Hewlett’s as from the verse of the newspapers.
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
They are vivid and real impressions of fighting and, as appeals
for recruiting, enormously inapt. But poetry does not exist for that.
The title poem is a lovely piece, Mr. Monro’s very best, the composition
which settled, or should have settled, all our doubts concerning his
genius. The others display that sombre misery which is the characteristic
note of his writing, which is extremely uncomfortable and, after a
little while, extremely impressive.
</p>

<p>
I may seem to have devoted too much space to the publications of
the Poetry Bookshop. But I think that, with luck, as time goes on, it
may bulk yet more largely in English letters. Mr. Monro, if he is careful,
may have the position that the <em>Mercure de France</em> held in Paris until
quite recently: that is, he may publish about ninety per cent of all the
good poetry that is published.

<p>
The war—again—disturbing our lives as a great tidal wave disturbs
sea and shore, has brought to the surface, as waves will, many
things of beauty. Among these, one that is not regarded, is Thomas
Hardy’s <em>Dynasts</em>, which has been abridged and produced by Mr. Granville
Barker. It is printed in three volumes and nineteen acts, with innumerable
choruses and semi-choruses. Mr. Barker has reduced the play to
three acts and the chorus to two persons who sit enthroned, one on
each side of the stage. Mr. Henry Ainley sits at a reading-desk lower
down in front and declaims the descriptive stage-directions. The setting
is a conventional design in grey to which slight additions are made
from time to time, but which remains for the most part unchanged.
Thus you see the men and women of Wessex in fear of invasion by
“Boney,” the victory and death of Nelson, the death and burial of Sir
John Moore, Wellington at Salamanca, Napoleon signing his abdication
at Fontainebleau, Wellington and Napoleon at Waterloo. The Napoleon
was bad: he laughed sardonically in the fashion of melodrama, but the
play transcended him. The tragedy was profoundly moving, the comedy
not less so. It is an extraordinary work, written in Mr. Hardy’s
graceless style, and probably the greatest of his compositions. One
thing only was wanting—an audience. That which is essentially impressive
must have something to impress—the listeners have a place
in a good play—and the grandeur of the occasion was sensibly diminished.
When we went, we asked the box-office attendant if we might
go in at half-price, on account of our uniforms, and he answered indifferently
that “we might if we liked.” When we got in, we understood.
There were about two rows in the stalls and two more in the pit. The
boxes were empty as far as I could see. I cannot understand the English
public. What more do they want now than to see Nelson on the <em>Victory</em>
and Wellington at Waterloo? Is it a cause of offence to them that the
play is by a great man?

translate sections from Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge,
Richmond P. Hobson, <em>et al.</em>, and publish them under the title “America
and the Next War.” There is no question that these gentlemen put
together are ten times as influential in the United States as von Bernhardi
was in Germany. And there is no question that their utterances
are just as inciting to militarism. If to them were added editorials from
the Hearst newspapers, with their millions of circulation, and the books
of certain prominent army officers, no one could convince the Japanese
that the United States is not a conceited, hot-headed, and militarist
nation. After the outbreak of a war we should plead in vain that we
are peace-loving and fight only in self-defence. “Have you not the
second largest navy in the world?” the Japanese would say. “Was any
nation threatening you? Did you not capture the Philippines by
force and subdue them against their will, practicing against the innocent
natives horrible atrocities? Would you not do the same to Japan
if you had the chance? Fortunately we are forewarned, and seize a favorable
occasion to free the Philippines, since you have broken your
promise to give them independence.” And we should feel that the
Japanese were monsters hiding their aggressive spirit under humanitarian
humbug.

<p>
Most of us have forgotten the spasm of “divine mission” that swept
over this country at the time of the Spanish-American war. We were
appointed by God to conquer or absorb the world, and bestow upon it,
willing or unwilling, our American <em>Kultur</em>. “Civilization” was, indeed,
the precise word we used, although we sometimes varied it with “free
institutions.” At the same time the beef trust was furnishing “embalmed
beef” to the army, and our economic system was at its very
depth of unsavoriness. The Spanish papers cartooned us, quite justly,
as “the American hog,” and the cartoons were reproduced broadcast
over this country to feed the fires of hate. A Spaniard became to us the
very impersonation of demoniacal cruelty. The country ran high with
the spy fever, while the Atlantic coast waited in some trepidation for
the imagined approach of Cervera’s squadron. We were prey to all the
grinning illusions of war.
</p>

<p>
European opinion was at this time largely against us. To most
Europeans we seemed a combination of pious humbug and bumptious
conceit. To be actively dangerous we should have needed only a powerful
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
armament. As it was, they regarded us with only distant apprehension.
But they were not for a moment deceived by our high-sounding
phrases. We were the most dollar-worshipping nation in the world, had
often proved ourselves so. They recalled the unpleasant experiences
they had had at the hands of Americans—vulgar tourists. The thing
was perfectly obvious. We had little fineness of feeling. What we were
fighting for was really dollars and cents, not the freedom of subject
peoples. At this time they set themselves to watch us very carefully.
Canada and the rest of America shared their feelings, with more bitterness.
</p>

<p>
Since then there has been little visible and striking change. We
still live under an inchoate and un-idealistic commercialism. The world
can thank us for very few treasures of literature, philosophy, or art.
Not a single great nation has any particular occasion to love us. To
most of them we are blasphemous and hateful. Hearst has more millions
and more newspapers than ever, and we are still subject to strong
popular hysteria—such as the recently-shown hatred of Germany. We
sit as judges on the world. We calmly assume that we could do no such
terrible things as other nations; that our <em>Kultur</em> is the best. At any
time we may again be ready to spread it by force of arms.
</p>

<p>
Now all the powerful nations of the world, except us, are weakening
each other in a terrific struggle. The occasion is seized in America by
the armament makers and a political party without an issue. To defend
ourselves we must arm! they say. Anyone who has taken the trouble to
read Bernhardi’s books will know that it is the precise argument he employed.
Political parties under commercialism are unscrupulous, and we
shall doubtless see the agitation raised to a national issue. Anything
to get the Democrats out of office. The probability is that the hysteria
will succeed. The only hope to the contrary is that it may be allayed,
not by opposition, but by prompt action on the part of the administration
which shall mend our present fences without committing us to any
definite policy of armament.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, however, that a President should be elected on the issue
of larger armament immediately after the European war. It is an insult
to the intelligence to pursue the logic of events further. The “defensive”
alliance against us, the “defensive” alliance for us—if, indeed we
could induce anybody to enter one—the constantly-increasing tension,
the <em>casus belli</em>, the repetition of history. But such a disastrous war
would not be a tragedy if we had so deserved it. The tragedy would be
that we should have no such intrinsic worth as has Germany to offer as
a defence. The tragedy would be that we had been so concerned about
the mote in our brother’s eye that we had failed to remove the beam in
our own.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hat</span> more felicitous combination could be desired than this: Albert
Spalding playing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, with the Thomas
Orchestra! Twice, four thousand people were warmed to genuine enthusiasm;
and at both the Friday and Saturday concerts the orchestra
men (whose utterly bored manner is their usual tribute) awakened and
showed the strongest appreciation for the young man’s art. Frederick
Stock beamed, fatherly, while he clapped his hands.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The displayers of sophisticated conceit and blasé judgment still
choose to regard Albert Spalding as a student. Their criticism, superficial
as it is, might have been based upon his playing of three or more
years back, when, along with the most marked talent, there was an
element of the conservatoire in his work. But the pupil has disappeared,
and there is now purely the artistic individual. And it follows naturally
that, for these same critics, unless one draws from a violin a tone as big
as a string bass, it cannot be beautiful.
</p>

<p>
For his two Chicago appearances he chose a work which is completely
suited to him. Spalding can play Mendelssohn. This composer,
with his happy delicacy, beauty, and rhythmic finesse, was safe in the
hands of the artist. A sturdier or a more sensuous fiddler might have
soiled the concerto. For Spalding is a spiritual aristocrat, a musician
whose tonal excellencies are not florid, but elegant; not passionate, but
of a fine intensity.
</p>

<p>
Technic?—One speaks of technic only when there is too much or
too little. Albert Spalding has, at the age of twenty-six, learned the
supreme art of self-expression; and both the self which he expresses
and the medium he employs for it are of the first order of fine things.

Love’s Highway
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Love and the Soul Maker</em>, by Mary Austin. [D. Appleton and Company,
New York.]
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is a certain generic myth, outcropping whenever the discovery
of some mysterious, hidden treasure is in question, which is that the
discoverer may possess only so much of it as he can carry away on his
own person. Whenever I met this climax in my childish reading my
greedy little soul rebelled because the hero might not have all that his
eyes could see instead of the negligible bit that he could handle with his
own muscles. Experience has taught that under no circumstances can
a man own more than he possesses within himself; this is as true of
material art forms as it is of culture and education. It is almost tragic
in its truth when we look about and see such a wealth of apparent happiness
and love and then look into our own impoverished hearts. We
may not covet either our neighbor’s automobile or his wife, but frequently
we do covet, in spite of good intentions, the happiness that he
derives from that automobile and that wife. Particularly weak are we
when we look down love’s highway and see what we believe to be limitless
and ideal joy. The little orbit in which we move seems sadly askew,
and it takes a book like Mary Austin’s <em>Love and the Soul Maker</em> to
make us understand that all the topsy-turviness of the present is but the
labor-pain of a saner, truer, happier future.
</p>

<p>
The author combines science and sentiment in a new way. Her
facts show that she has read widely; her conclusions show that she has
thought deeply; her sentiments show that she has felt—at least potentially—most,
if not all, of the joys and sorrows which the practice and
malpractice of love produce. And the one shining truth that she has
discovered in all this hidden treasure of sex happiness is that “<em>we’ve a
right to as much love as we can work up into the stuff of a superior personality</em>.”
This truth is thrown out as independently of conventions,
prejudices, religious beliefs or practices as a searchlight is independent
of the hinges that hold it in place. It is the ultimate measure of what is
good or what is bad in love; it is the standard by which all sex problems
must finally be adjusted. She goes on to say that “taking anything over
what we can give back in some form or other to the social sum is my
notion of sinning”—and an inspired notion of sinning it is, too. We are
all searching for the treasure of love happiness, yet no one may justly
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
take more than he can carry away in inspiration and the impulse of
creating something within or without that will add to the sum total of
human happiness.
</p>

<p>
Between facts and sentiment Mrs. Austin leans to sentiment—yet
why not? She is not writing for the elect body of sex students, but for
ordinary men and women. Those who have read little or nothing of sex
psychology would find cold, uncompromising facts too difficult a diet.
Offering them such an argument would be like comforting a bumped
child with the multiplication table. By means of such a book as <em>Love
and the Soul Maker</em> it may be possible for even the ossifying brains of
dogmatists to catch a glimmer of light on our present sex problems,
while such dazzlingly and ruthlessly true books as Havelock Ellis writes
may petrify several additional lobes.
</p>

<p>
Although not openly propagandic, Mrs. Austin has a decided philosophy
of life which she sets forth in a dozen different ways and which,
without saying so, she hopes her reader will accept. She insists that
“the proper end of loving is not personal but racial; it is the Soul
Maker’s most precious commodity,” and that love pirates or love grafters
commit their most venal sin by believing that love is its own excuse.
As Mrs. Austin expresses it, “Love for love’s sake is the shibboleth by
which they blunt the unassailable fact that love was not invented for
love’s sake but for life’s.” Here, of course, is a radical point of departure
which will turn many readers away from her pages; it may, however,
induce an equal number to read further.
</p>

<p>
The flaws in our modern system of marriage are more closely seen
and more cleverly pointed out than are the remedies offered. For example,
the author shows that modern society asks of marriage “things
it was never meant to pay”; yet her remedy is vague. And again:
“The initial mistake about marriage is in regarding it as a condition, a
state, when it is primarily a relation” and may exist in spite of very unfavorable
conditions and quite apart from them. Delightfully, indeed,
does she puncture the time-worn fallacy of platonic friendships: “I
doubt that there can be any informing intimacy between men and women
unless there exists also the potentiality of passionate experience.” Yet
many of her views are completely radical. “There never has been a time
since man stood up and knew himself for man,” she writes, “that the
major process of love has been reproductive,” and later she points out
that “chief among the uses of passion is the raising of the percentage
of values in those who entertain it.” She cuts off all the frills of convention,
ceremony, tradition; strips away all but the essential naked
truth germ and declares: “Marriage is an agreement between any pair
to practice mate-love toward one another, with intention.”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
Marriage, thus simplified, would not, indeed could not, be the failure
which modern society so widely accepts with resignation instead of combating
with thoughtful dissatisfaction. We have become so racially hypnotized
that we do not distinguish between associated facts (such as
food, shelter, religious sanction, obedience, etc.) and the essential truth
of mate-love. “The primary obligation of lovers is to love,” she says.
This done, all will adjust itself; and yet lest any should draw the over-quick
conclusion that Mrs. Austin advocates free love, let me also add
that she says: “To love and to keep on loving. This is the one way
of making marriage do its work in the world.”
</p>

<p>
As a remedy she begs women to open their eyes to the fact that
marriage is not now the only career for them. That marriage does not
fill the lives of those who enter it is evidenced by the divorce courts.
Tentatively Mrs. Austin suggests that instead of dissolving so many
marriages it would be wiser to unload the excessive strain put upon
them. Let economics take hold of the problem of the mother, who for
the sake of providing bread for herself and her children crucifies her
own personality, ignores her own right to happiness upon the racial
conception of marriage. Very frankly she explains what marriage
should do for us: “First of all to satisfy the hunger of the body for its
natural mate ... and finally it must satisfy the need of companionship
on the intimate and personal side of life.” She hints that “it is
immensely more important that a mating pair should relish kissing together
than that they should both be Presbyterian.”
</p>

<p>
She is hopeful concerning the final abolishing of prostitution if the
present marriage customs are changed. She is emphatic in the need of
young people being enlightened in regard to marital experiences and
problems, but her suggestions are indefinite and inconclusive. However,
much may be overlooked for her emphasis of the fact that sex is an
active principal and that the best love-life is that which makes the best
use of love’s activities. She admonishes us to “play fair alike in loving
and unloving,” which means that love is not a light thing of a day, but
must be great enough and strong enough to control itself, even to sacrifice
itself for the greatest racial good—and never to sell itself from a
motive of personal selfishness, or for the bliss of an hour.
</p>

<p>
The highway that Mrs. Austin lays out for love is rough and stony
in spots, and yet its goal of racial betterment through achievement as
well as by means of offspring is not to be despised.

Dutch Bourgeoisie
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Small Souls</em>, by Louis Couperus. [Dodd, Mead and Company, New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Rain, rain.... It is always raining in Holland; the skies are
ever hidden behind muddy clouds, and in the damp, bleak atmosphere
straggle grey figures with stony faces. It is painful to follow Couperus
through the four hundred odd pages of his gloomy novel, to meet only
“small souls,” petty men and women whose sole interest lies in dinner
parties and endless gossip. Empty, tedious, stupid “society,” without
even the piquant vice that makes attractive the bourgeoisie of Balzac,
Maupassant, or Zola. The least boring figure among the asinine menagerie
is that of the heroine, Constance, whose sole virtue consists in the
fact that she had committed adultery in her early life. The author has
not brought in a single positive type of Holland’s artistic or intellectual
circles to counteract the general gloom of the picture; he has evidently
determined to hold his readers within the frame of a family-epic, to
focus their attention on one particular aspect of life in the Hague, the
shallowest, the palest. As this novel presents the translation of the
first part of the author’s tetralogy, we must be patient and consider the
book as a prelude to the developing drama. Already we see at the end
of this volume promising symptoms of a new, real life, to be manifested
in the growing boy, Adrian—big, healthy, sturdy, who despises his petty
relatives with their noisy intrigues, and whose “boyish lips, with their
faint shading of dawn, curve into a scornful smile as he says: ‘It’s all
about nothing!’” We shall eagerly look forward to the following
volumes, for Couperus is an artist, a deep psychologist, a follower of
Zola; his method may be old, arch-realistic, but, as I say, he is an artist,
hence thrilling.

James Stephens: Poet and Pagan
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Demi-Gods</em>, by James Stephens. [The Macmillan Company,
New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
God’s most high messengers and certain Irish loafers nest well together.
James Stephens was the first man to discern this and other
plain, albeit unique, facts; and in the <em>Demi-Gods</em> he takes the reader
into a delightful confidence, telling him the inmost thoughts of three
angels, their two companions (also Irish), a philosophic donkey, an
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
ecstatic crow, and the like of them. The angels learn table-manners and
similar ethics from the two Celtic vagabonds, whom they chance upon
when they touch foot to earth, one dark night. The father-vagabond
gets daily food for the party, paying for it when he isn’t temperamentally
swept into stealing; the other, who is the dearest kind of an Irish girl,
naturally in love with the youngest angel, does the cooking and mothering
for them all,—and celestial wisdom is shelved during the acquirement
of so much worldly knowledge.
</p>

<p>
How can the astonishing charms of this book be described? In the
first place, there is poetry—neither cadent nor decadent poetry, but the
sort of prose that conveys the most finely imagined poetic thought.
And there is contrast. Such contrast! From the calm conversation of
angels to the braying of an ass is the easiest jump for Stephens. It is a
gentle slide from paragraphs of delicate dawn-picturing to a peasant’s
narration of brawls and thieving, or a description of the angels attired in
Pat McCann’s trousers. And, given the latitude of half a dozen quotations,
one might prove that this same Stephens was a deep-gazing mystic.
Nor would his extreme paganism be difficult to establish. But to
avoid all the inevitable shruggings of literary shoulders, if one really said
these things about the man, let it be quickly stated that James Stephens
is before all else an artist, a writer with a superlative sense of humor
and a pleasantly incomprehensible imagination.
</p>

<p>
While a deeper probing of his mysticism or paganism (as such)
would perhaps bring about a sudden discounting of his humor and his
poetic sensibilities, it is necessary to remember that Stephens is Irish,
with all the implied values of that temperament. Therefore, it is well
to consider the author of <em>The Demi-Gods</em> to be this day’s most unique
literary light. The combination stands alone.

Unfulfilled Expectations
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>A Lady of Leisure</em>, by Ethel Sidgwick. [Small, Maynard and
Company, Boston.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Long, diffuse, sometimes clever, sometimes pointless conversations
mark this latest book of an author from whom we had come to expect
only the best. Miss Sidgwick could not write anything that did not
have passages of keen insight and shrewd handling of our commonplace
humanity, but here their value is hidden under an avalanche of words—words—words.
The slight plot—which of course is no fault—deals
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
with the whims of the daughter of a great London surgeon. She overcomes
parental objection and enters a dressmaking establishment; but we are
given no particularly vital picture of this life. There are several young
people whose love affairs become mutually mixed, but ultimately untangled—all
of which is done by means of conversations, jerky, exclamatory,
unrestrained. This method is true to life because such
chatter is exactly the way modern people talk, but nevertheless our
ears ache with it, and we find ourselves longing for a paragraph of
straightaway description or narration, which never comes.
</p>

<p>
The frivolous and empty atmosphere is all well enough for a relish,
but it is unsatisfying as a total, particularly from one who can give too
much that is worth while. It is like a continuous afternoon tea, or a
lemon meringue pie with nothing but the meringue.

The readers of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> may remember these lines: they
were meant to interpret Debussy. I challenge Llewellyn Jones to
“object” to this gem and to question its “sense”! The staunchest conservative
will agree that of all arts music presents the widest liberty
for subjective interpretation, especially for such an autonomous artist
as a poet. “There is some music which should be described by poets
rather than <a id="corr-19"></a>exposed by inquisitive aestheticians. Of such is the magical
music of Debussy.” This from Lawrence Gilman’s latest book. Mr.
Gilman evidently considers himself a good member in both categories,
for he follows up the quoted remark with unrestrained effusions of
colorful descriptions of Landscape-music, Sea-music, Death-music. It is
charming reading, though at times the unbridled Pegasus causes you
dizziness; not that you are encountered with daringly-new views or
dazzling ideas: Mr. Gilman is too much of an American for such extravagance.
It is the manner of his exposition, the ravishing richness of
his style, that endangers your mental equilibrium. Judge for yourself:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
<p class="noindent">
Debussy, when he wrote this delectable and adorable music (<em>Rondes de Printemps</em>),
sent his spirit into the woods and fields, through gardens and orchards and petal-showered
lanes, and upon the moors and hills; he trod the brown soil of the earth,
but he also looked long up into the green branches and the warm, gusty sky of May,
and savored the fragrant winds.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Is it not enchanting? But when you are treated to such nectar on
nearly every page, you sigh for the elegant, reserved Romain Rolland,
who expresses his enthusiasm for Debussy in a cooler, yet by no means
less convincing, way.
</p>

<p>
Aside from this purely external characteristic the book contains
very interesting remarks on the treatment of natural elements and
phenomena by various composers. The invention of new instruments,
the development of the art of orchestration, and general new conceptions
of our age, have drawn a sharp line of distinction between the old and
the new interpretations of nature in music. While the old composers
(among the old the author places not only Hayden and Beethoven, but
also Wagner and Grieg) approached Nature either as a subject to be
faithfully rendered, or as a provocator of direct emotional reactions in
themselves, to the new composers (Debussy, d’Indy, Loeffler, MacDowell)
Nature “is a miraculous harp, an instrument of unlimited range
and inexhaustible responsiveness, upon which the performer may improvise
at his pleasure,” to quote the inimitable original. The classification
is rather hazardous; the importance of Loeffler is greatly exaggerated,
but as a purely subjective view the work of Mr. Gilman is interesting.

A Pasteurized “Man and Superman”
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>The Raft</em>, by Coningsby Dawson. [Henry Holt and Company,
New York.]
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<em>The Raft</em> is based on the same idea as Shaw’s—<em>minus</em> moral shocks,
mental exhilaration, and the Superman. The theory is served as strong
drink in the one, as good boy’s tea in the other. The same idea receives
such different treatment that the person who would pronounce <em>Man and
Superman</em> a “corrupt play” might speak of <em>The Raft</em>, as a beautiful story,
provided a few courageous truths which it was necessary for the author
to state in order to refute, could be forgiven. It is a harmless compromise
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
between the belief that no literature has a right to exist that is
not suitable for a girl in her teens, and the conviction that men and
women must face life as it is.
</p>

<p>
In <em>The Raft</em>, we read this figurative suggestion of the theory:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
We’re girls adrift on a raft and we can’t swim. Over there’s the land of marriage
with the children, the homes and the husbands; we’ve no means of getting to it.
Unless some of the men see us and put out in boats to our rescue, we’ll be swept into
the hunger of mid-ocean. But they’re too busy to notice us.... Always wanting,
wanting, wanting the things that only men can give.... Did men ever want
to be married or was it always necessary to catch them?
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
In <em>Man and Superman</em> we find a more liberal statement:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
To a woman, a man is only a means to the end of getting children and rearing
them. Vitality in woman is a blind fury of creation. What other work has she in
life but to get a husband? It is a woman’s business to get married as soon as possible,
and a man’s to keep unmarried as long as he can.... You think that you are
the pursuer, and she pursued. Fool, it is you who are the pursued, the destined
prey.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
During the last few years stories and plays exploiting this doctrine
have been hurled thick and fast in the attempt to batter down so-called
romantic love, romantic though fortified not only by the fancies of the
poets and novelists but also by the analyses of the scientists and the
experiences of life. According to these stories, love is nothing more or
less than a passion for reproduction, a desire for children. This idea is
being emphasized by two very different types for two very different reasons:
one tries to make a Don Quixote of romantic love and hopes by
ridicule to eliminate it as the great motive and to give some of the
other passions a chance in literature; the other considers everything
even suggestive of sex unmoral, and so searches for an excuse to justify
the gratification of a natural craving. Neither satire nor platitudes can
alter nature.
</p>

<p>
Love, they say, considered as intense personal affection is an idea
purely fanciful, romantic. If so to consider it is romantic, scientists are
romantic; for such men as Lankester and Pycraft say “the view that
the sequel of mate hunger is the dominant instinct has no foundation
in fact. Desire for the sake of the pleasure of its gratification, not its
consequences, is the only hold on life which any race possesses. Love
is the attribute upon which this preservation of the race depends.”
</p>

<p>
In other words it is a case of cause and effect. That the joy of
motherhood is greater than any other joy in a woman’s life has absolutely
nothing to do with the question as to whether or not the hope
of that joy was the reason for the selection of a mate. The question is
not one of superiority but priority; not which is the greater, but which
came first; which is the cause and which the effect. If the desire for
<a id="page-52" class="pagenum" title="52"></a>
children is the cause of what we call love, the only logical outcome is
that in selection any woman could not refuse any man fit to be the
father of her children on the ground that he did not appeal to her
personally. Life does not support such a conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Why woman’s choice is not impersonal is only one of the many
things that cannot be explained by the theory that makes her desire
for children the sole cause of attraction. It does not explain too many
things: faithless wives, some childless marriages, children found on
door-steps, abortions, some prostitution, why some women never marry
for fear of children, or why man is not the coy, reluctant, elusive creature
defined, though not pictured, by Dawson and Shaw.
</p>

<p>
No wonder it fails to explain; for children, instead of being the
whole cause are the result of only a part of the cause, mate hunger—a
hunger of body, mind, and spirit. Love is the feeling for the one that
seems to supply those needs, the impulse toward that one. The sooner
we realize that the attraction between men and women is not all
physical any more than it is all mental and spiritual, and that sex is in
all three phases, the sooner shall we reach the truth; the sooner shall
we hear the last of one type that prudishly denies physical attraction or
else tries to “purify” it by making it a means to an end, and of the
other type that sees in marriage only physical union.
</p>

<p>
The theory will not stand either a logical or an emotional test.
Not only can it not explain this confusion of cause and effect, this mistaking
the part of love for its whole; but it also cannot answer why it
should look to the future for a cause when love is so vitally a thing of
the present; nor why it was ever thought necessary to find any explanation
outside of itself for the attraction between men and women. If
there is any passion in the world that does not need a justification other
than its mere existence, it is love. For though realizing the exaltation
of moral passion, the exhilaration of mental passion, no one can deny
that it is through love we know intense, vivid personal happiness—happiness
that is vibrant, full of color, rapturous.
</p>

<p>
But it is absurd to try to analyze it; it is even more so to argue
about it: but really women have grown very tired of having men tell
them why they marry, tired of this confusion of result with cause, of a
part with the whole, tired of the belittling of love by people who have
never experienced it, tired of this sex obsession. It is doubly absurd to
waste time in arguing when the best argument I can offer against the
Raft theory is the book itself, where the author spends most of his time
disproving his own definitely-stated idea through the actions of his
characters. It is interesting to see that both Dawson and Shaw should,
by methods diametrically opposite, show how fallacious is their statement
by exactly the same circumstance,—that is, by having the woman

care passionately for <em>the</em> man, not <em>a</em> man. That fact alone routs the
whole theory. Certainly Cherry and Jehane have very decided personal
preferences regardless of the next generation; moreover the Golden
Woman and “heaps of other well-bred women” will not marry for fear
of children; and Peter, Ockey, and the Faun Man insist on being ardent
lovers that vainly pursue.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding these contradictions throughout the book, the
author keeps on bravely and inartistically reiterating his Raft motives,
as if to keep up his courage. Possibly because he realizes that he is
losing his theme, he starts another which is really the one consistently
developed. This second theme is that love is never reciprocal: that at
the best it is a case of one loving, the other allowing; that usually it is
a case of one loving and the other not even allowing. He starts an endless
chain of unrequited affection: Glory loves Peter; Peter loves
Cherry; Cherry, the Faun Man; the Faun the Golden Woman; the
Golden Woman, herself—or is it Peter? That is one chain; and another
is Ockey loves Jehane; Jehane, Barrington; Barrington, Nan.
</p>

<p>
These two themes working at cross purposes are typical of the book
which is a mass of contradictions of this author’s own definitely expressed
ideas, and of life. So many things do not ring true: the labored,
morbid, commonplace treatment of Peter, “the <a id="corr-22"></a>’maginative child,” as an
exponent of the artistic temperament; the lack of love as the sole cause
of Ockey’s failure, when he needs so many other things to make a man
of him; the marriage of Nan and Barrington as the ideal union, when
neither one has a nature intense enough to feel a great love, when even
such love as they know has never been put to the merciless tests that
life uses; the brooding, year in and year out, of the unmarried women
over the loss of the joys of motherhood, and their lack of interest in any
other phase of life; Jehane’s unworthiness, emphasized by the author in
person and through his characters, when her actions with different treatment
might have made her almost a heroine; the declared finality of so
many things that are really only initial steps; platitudes as answers to
the vital questions of life.
</p>

<p>
Most of these false notes come from the fact that the theories of
the author and the actions of his characters are not in harmony. Whenever
I hear writers talking of such discords and saying that they are
obliged to let their characters work out their own salvations, I always
consider the attitude an affectation. But I have changed my mind.
Dawson seems to be left alone on his Raft, shouting his untenable
theories till he is hoarse; while his characters, ignoring him, have
reached land and are living their own lives. I found myself in the
absurd position of resenting the author’s interference with those vivid,
<a id="page-54" class="pagenum" title="54"></a>
distinctive, powerful characters he had created; of wanting to tell him
to keep his hands off, and let them tell their own story.
</p>

<p>
And left to themselves they tell it unflinchingly. What if the treatment
is obvious and conventional? It is obvious treatment of the great
mysteries of life; conventional treatment of its beauties.

The advancement of science at the expense of man is one of the most pernicious
things in the world. The stunted man is a retrogression in the human race: he
throws a shadow over all succeeding generations. The tendencies and natural purpose
of the individual science become degenerate, and science itself is finally shipwrecked:
it has made progress, but has either no effect at all on life or else an immoral one.—<em>Nietzsche.</em>

<div class="sentrev">
<p class="noindent">
<em>Gustave Flaubert</em>, by Emile Faguet. <em>Balzac</em>, by the same author. [Houghton
Mifflin Company, Boston.] Emile Faguet is a critic of the old school, an academician.
He analyzes the writers thoroughly, profoundly, comprehensively, applying a uniform
scholarly method. He gives the biographies of Flaubert and Balzac, reviews their
works, and finally discusses their general importance for literature. You do not find
any sparkling revelations or extraordinary insight, but you form an adequate opinion
of the chief characteristics of the two great Frenchmen. The translations are good;
Mr. Thorley, who did the Balzac, has proved that in the rôle <a id="corr-23"></a>of a translator he runs
less risk than when undertaking to interpret Verlaine.
</p>

<p>
<em>Bahaism: The Modern Social Religion</em>, by Horace Holley. [Mitchell Kennerley,
New York.] Another example of overestimation of Oriental thought. The success
of Tagore’s second-rate allegories gave Mr. Holley the idea of displaying before the
ever-thirsting Western mind another Eastern “great”. Bahaism, as interpreted by the
writer, is one of the “57 varieties” of the blessed Christian Socialism. The world
must be reformed, nicely, humbly, altruistically, without causing any damage to
State and Society. Naive and dull like a Sunday sermon at an Ethical Society.
</p>

<p>
<em>Woman and War</em>, by Olive Schreiner. [Frederick A. Stokes Company, New
York.] A timely pamphlet, reprinted as a fragment from the famous book <em>Woman
and Labor</em>. The author claims that woman can carry on war as well as man, considering
modern war implements; but as a sculptor would resent the idea of hurling
his creations on the ramparts to stop the breaches made by the enemy, so does the
human child-bearer instinctively antagonize the reckless destruction of that which she
has at so much cost produced; for “men’s bodies are our woman’s work of art.”
</p>

<p>
<em>Appearances</em>, by G. Lowes Dickinson. [Doubleday, Page and Company, New
York.] The title vindicates the author’s superficiality. Impressions of India, China,
Japan, America, are bewilderingly crowded in a dazzling bouquet, revealing charming
brilliance on the part of the observer, but lack of profound insight. A rapidly-changing
panorama of faces and places, a cinematograph. “All America is Niagara.
Force without direction, noise without significance, speed without accomplishment.”
Such aphorisms lavishly scattered throughout the pages make the book ideal train
reading.
</p>

<p>
<em>Psychology General and Applied</em>, by Hugo Münsterberg. [D. Appleton and Company,
New York.] This new text-book by the Harvard professor summarizes various
aspects of psychology and will be of help to the student who seeks facts rather than
speculation. Mr. Münsterberg is at his best when he deals with a college audience;
his reputation and prestige would be quite safe if he limited his activity to that field
and did not indulge in pro-German pamphleteering.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Story-Life of Napoleon</em>, by Wayne Whipple. [The Century Company, New
York.] The life of the “Man of Destiny” is an inexhaustible source for historians
and biographers. Mr. Whipple has compiled a new biography of the Corsican, based
exclusively on stories and anecdotes as related by various authorities. Those for
whom Napoleon is the grandest phenomenon in history will feel grateful to the author
for his enormous work performed lovingly and inspiringly.
</p>

<p>
<em>Stories from Northern Myths</em>, by Emilie Kip Baker. [The Macmillan Company,
New York.] I enjoy reading Greek mythology in spring, Hindu legends in summer,
the Bible at any time, Norse sagas in winter nights. This book is a skillful
composition of the most interesting myths of the North, written with irresistible
<a id="page-56" class="pagenum" title="56"></a>
charm. It is ideal reading in the blissful moments of mental relaxation, when you
dismiss temporarily all “problems” and plunge into the enchanting abyss of the
Non-Real.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Architecture of Humanism</em>, by Geofry Scott. [Houghton Mifflin Company,
Boston.] A cold, merciless wielding of the scythe that the author admits is dogmatic
criticism. Even the crucified Ruskin has more thorns added to his crown; but still we
fail to see the object of this book in holding up all architectural ideals as “fallacies”.
</p>

<p>
<em>Father Ralph</em>, by Gerald O’Donovan. [Mitchell Kennerley, New York.] Ralph
O’Brien was born to be a priest. One might almost say, considering his mother’s
attitude, that he was a priest before he was born, and his bringing up was single-eyed
to that end. Only as he grows older does he begin to find flaws in the supposedly
flawless church of God. Then as he brings his keen young mind to these problems
he fights against the religious decadence of Ireland, and causes the author’s pen to
rush along through a torrent of socialistic and revolutionary indignation.
</p>

<p>
<em>Balshazzar Court</em>; or, Village Life in New York City, by Simon Strumsky.
[Henry Holt and Company, New York.] These eight connected essays concern the
modern apartment house filled with strange families which become linked together
by the telegraphy of domestics; the street, Broadway, teeming with its interest in
unnatural things; with the show which one knows perfectly beforehand through the
kindness of the newspaper reporters; and others. The author sees the unimportant
trifles that make up urban life, and lifts them into whimsical prominence.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Wonderful Romance</em>, by Pierre de Coulevain. [Dodd, Mead and Company,
New York.] “To America, country of new thoughts”—thus does the author dedicate
her last book. Almost as if she could foresee her death, Mlle. Fabre (Pierre de Coulevain
was her pen name) wrote of conclusions and impressions long stored up in her
brain. Like her previous books, this is a collection of thoughts and observations set
down in a charming but desultory way.
</p>

<p>
<em>To-Day’s Daughter</em>, by Josephine Daskam Bacon. [D. Appleton and Company,
New York.] <em>To-Day’s Daughter</em> is an utterly American book dealing with our peculiar
present-day problems. Mrs. Bacon forces no conclusions upon the reader, for
each case is “different.” The author limits her modern woman in no way except to
make her choose one purpose and to show her that she cannot be a dozen different
women and achieve success in all directions. She proves that woman must have a
cohering line, a central motive to which other things are subservient, and a due regard
to the environment where Fate has placed her.
</p>

<p>
<em>Lucas’ Annual</em>, edited by E. V. Lucas. [The Macmillan Company, New York.]
Of course, the correct literary pose toward even the best “collections” is one of
indulgent condescension. Nevertheless, we must admit that in Lucas’s collection
Ruskin’s criticism of one of Browning’s poems gives us a good laugh and an intellectual
challenge; that Barrie’s <em>Hyphen</em> and the prize novel, <em>Spoof</em>, are clever satires
on literary style; that Browning’s letter emphasizes what we felt while prying into the
Browning Letters: that our self-respect could never again be the same;—that as a
whole the book appeals to our sense of humor and to our literary taste.
</p>

<p>
<em>Nothing Else Matters</em>, by William Samuel Johnson. [Mitchell Kennerley, New
York.] That jaded epithet, “like champagne,” should have been reserved for this
novel, for it bubbles and sparkles and leaves a luxurious taste in one’s literary mouth;
and, while under its pleasurable influence, one is eager to declare that heroines of
<a id="page-57" class="pagenum" title="57"></a>
today should all bear resemblance to the charming little human who laughs and loves
through these pages.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Bird-Store Man</em>, by Norman Duncan. [Fleming H. Revell Company, New
York.] The old, Sabbath-scented story, practically told by the title, is in this case
partially redeemed by a binding of tan, cream, and pale green.
</p>

<p>
<em>Altogether Jane</em>, by Herself. [Mitchell Kennerley, New York.] When a sane,
intelligent woman speaks frankly and cleverly, with neither lush nor morbidity, the
public owes itself the pleasure of hearing her; and, given that hearing, Jane, in this
healthy chronicle, will be found convincing.
</p>

<p>
<em>Personality Plus</em>, by Edna Ferber. [Frederick A. Stokes Company, New York.]
One or two personalities plus slang raised to the nth power minus profundity gives the
readable, salable unit which Edna Ferber presents in this story of a blossoming college
chap.
</p>

<p>
<em>The True Ulysses S. Grant</em>, by Gen. Charles King. [J. B. Lippincott Company,
Philadelphia.] Some patriotic hawker should get the idea and the permission to sell
this informative volume at that sight-seen tomb on Riverside Drive, for Grant can’t
have too many friends.
</p>

<p>
<em>Nancy the Joyous</em>, by Edith Stowe. [Reilly and Britton, Chicago.] Nancy, one
animated beam of bookish sunlight, is just too sweet and frank and “wholesome” for
anything—even to read.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Torch Bearer</em>, by Reina Melcher Marquis. [D. Appleton and Company, New
York.] Once again the reader is asked to consider a married woman with a talent—a
situation which has become epidemic. In this case the plot is too big for the writer’s
ability and the whole story is shallow and sketchy.
</p>

<p>
<em>Selina</em>, by George Madden Martin. [D. Appleton and Company.] Like so many
writers who achieve a first success, Mrs. Martin has not done nearly so well with
Selina as she did with Emmy Lou. Selina is natural but colorless. The Mid-Victorian
setting (which is repeatedly emphasized) is of Mid-Victorian mediocrity. The plot is
merely a series of unstartling incidents.
</p>

<p>
<em>Essays.—Political and Historical</em>, by Charlemagne Tower. [J. B. Lippincott Company,
Philadelphia.] Those who have been taught to believe government is the most
important thing in our existence and is an institution founded on truth, justice and
human needs will if they read this book at all sincerely, close it in wonder. Despite
the “skill and thoroughness” with which the book is written one cannot help questioning
the meaning of all this petty, diplomatic scheming and complicated governmental
legislating.
</p>

<p>
<em>Coasting Bohemia</em>, by J. Comyns Carr. [The Macmillan Company, New York.]
Essays, some of which appeared in an English daily, the real value and literary worth
of which compel us, who live in America, to realize our lack of journalistic criticism.
Millais, Alma-Tadema, Burne-Jones, Whistler, and many others are written about in
a manner that surely must have aided in public understanding and appreciation.
</p>

<p>
<em>Anne Feversham</em>, by J. C. Snaith. [D. Appleton and Company, New York.]
“Delightful,” “charming,” “entertaining,” and all the rest of the usual publishers’ adjectives
for usual books. They try to justify this one because of its historical background,
which, however, is too slight to save it.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Commodore</em>, by Maud Howard Peterson. [Lothrop, Lee and Shepard Company,
Boston.] A lean-on-me-Grandpapa little boy, plenty of sentiment, a style which
<a id="page-58" class="pagenum" title="58"></a>
some people consider adorable, incidents of wholesome morality pinned to a background
of naval stations and marine affairs, make this a book which the young may
read with impunity—and, if young enough, with satisfaction and a grim resolve to go
and do likewise.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Grand Assize</em>, by Hugh Carton. [Doubleday, Page and Company, New
York.] Milton built a heaven for his highest imaginings; Dante dug a hell and cast
all his personal enemies into it; the author of <em>The Grand Assize</em> puts the Last Judgment
into a municipal court room and tries the Plutocrat, the Derelict, the Daughter
of Joy, the Drunkard, and all his other pet aversions. This he does with an intellect
less alive to the essence of human nature than that of the most biased, graft-elected
judge of the last decade, for he treats life as a theory and people as classified
emotions.
</p>

<p>
<em>Wintering Hay</em>, by John Trevena. [Mitchell Kennerley, New York.] This
tragedy of weakness will hold everyone who has ever tried to pour success into some
sieve-like character, too negative to stand alone. So well is Cyril Rossingall depicted
that the reader loses the consummate art of the author in his seeming artlessness.
Its setting is life in London and Dartmoor; its plot is life as lived by English
gentlefolk; its theme is the reflex effect of events on life; its essence is simply—life.
</p>

<p>
<em>The Story of Beowulf</em>, translated from the Anglo-Saxon by Ernest J. B. Kirtland.
[Thomas Y. Crowell Company, New York.] Once again the ancient Anglo-Saxon
manuscript, treasured through centuries in the British Museum, has been made
over into up-to-date English with all the trimmings of introduction, foot-notes, appendix
and frontispiece. As a mere layman, we believe it to be well done.
</p>

<p>
<em>Stories without Tears</em>, by Barry Pain. [Frederick A. Stokes Company, New
York.] Trivial of plot, sometimes hardly more than an incident, these stories capture
some poise, pose, or feature of life and cast it masterfully into a medallion of
delightful symmetry. Sad, gay, amusing, pathetic, they have the de Maupassant twist
with all its perennial fascination.
</p>

<p>
<em>Marta of the Lowlands</em>, by Angel Guimera. [Doubleday, Page and Company,
New York.] What Lady Gregory has done for the Irish, Angel Guimera has done
for the <a id="corr-26"></a>Catalan drama (Catalonia is a province in Spain) by picturing the characteristics
of the people in various dramatic situations. In <em>Marta of the Lowlands</em> he has
shown the tragic and absolute ownership of the landed proprietor over the peasants
who live on his territory.
</p>

<p>
<em>A Soldier of The Legion</em>, by C. N. and A. M. Williamson. [Doubleday, Page and
Company, New York.] The Williamsons know Northern Africa and if you know
them—you surely do, this being their fifteenth book—you will know what to expect
here. Those people who still can find time for nothing but war “literature” may be
interested to know that the Legion described in this book is fighting in France for the
Allies in the present war.
</p>

<p>
<em>Private Affairs</em>, by Charles McEvoy. [Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston.] It
is human to be curious, and when we get a chance we like to know all about the
intimate affairs of other people. In this book the affairs are told in such a direct,
interesting manner, without the pettiness of gossip, that we find sufficient excuse for
our human weakness.

I read <em>Wedded</em> with much interest and really want to congratulate you upon your
courage in producing it. As I told the author, whom I recently met, I do not think
technically it is perfect: he has overdrawn the minister and made an author’s comment
in his lines. I feel the last line absolutely out of key; for the effect, in my judgment,
would have been much stronger if the minister had been less obviously the
hypocrite. Aside from a little bungling in the opening, I think, however, that its
sincerity is much more important than this captious criticism. I feel he put over
quite clearly a situation in human life which should be presented. And it was courageous
of you to affront public opinion, as you no doubt have, and give place to
such a sincere little piece of life. I wonder when the world is going to let us talk
about all the things we now smirk over and know. Once we can place these sex
matters on the same plane of conversation as we do pork and cheese then they will
really cease to be important. I believe in the reticences of taste and proportion—but
not those of subject matter. And sooner or later the question of birth control
must be given wide publicity, so that only wanted children will come into the world.
So long as functionally the woman must bear the labour and thus suffer unequally in
parenthood, so should we do everything through education to arm her against assuming
unwilling burdens. When children are born of free choice in marriage then they
will partake of a higher dignity, and parenthood itself will mean more than a functional
disturbance and a matter of rebellion it now is with many. Any play which
makes us question our nice polite functions about morality should be accessible to
those not afraid of new ideas. It is curious how little faith the innate conservative
has in human nature and the finer things of life. So afraid are they that they would
bind people by old traditions and not personally-achieved opinions. <em>Wedded</em> presents
in vivid phrase a fragment of life which has no doubt come to many a woman, and
I heartily congratulate you for the courage which prompted you to give the author a
hearing.

The November number is the best yet. I don’t like Iris’s work as well as I do
Bodenheim’s; judging by these poems I think he has been too much praised. Bodenheim
makes some superb contributions to language and imagery. Langner’s play
doesn’t escape the querulous note in spots, but it is worth doing and is done well on
the whole. Darrow’s article is well-knit and presents an idea. The best thing in the
issue is Kaun’s translation. And I dislike very much your article on Emma Goldman,
because it falls so far below the hardness of thought it should have had.
</p>

<p>
I have taken much to heart two articles in the first <em>New Republic</em>: Rebecca West’s
<em>The Duty of Harsh Criticism</em> and the editors’ <em>Force and Ideas</em>. We who are saying
things in public have a simply tremendous responsibility not only to feel, but to
know, and to use the acid test on everything we say. Your article shows that you
have been carried away by a personality to approval of a social program, and is the
most convincing proof I have ever seen that belief in anarchism is a product of the
artistic temperament rather than the result of an intelligent attempt to criticise and
<a id="page-60" class="pagenum" title="60"></a>
remould society. I know you did not intend it to be so; that is the reason it annoys
me so much. It was a wise and necessary thing to correct misapprehensions about
Emma Goldman’s personality; that you have done fairly well; though even that is
marred by too much protesting and a substitution of a somewhat sentimental elation
for power of mind and emotion. But your offhand generalities on the top of the third
page are just the sort of shoddy thinking that justifies conservatives in dismissing
social theorists with a sneer, and imprisoning them when they get dangerous. These
generalities do not even accurately represent Wilde’s essay. It is not that I disagree
with you; I recognize a fundamental truth in these things if it could only be disentangled,
made definite, and applied. But to a discerning and unprejudiced reader it is
quite evident that in order to save yourself the trouble and unromantic grind of doing
this, you have made a lot of meaningless assumptions without really knowing very much
about history or anthropology or psychology or any of the other wonderful tools which
modern heroes have put at the service of the human will. You have the blind faith
of a Catholic saint in divine revelation; the only difference is that the terms of the
revelation are altered.

<p>
As a thing entirely apart from the above objection, the sporadic violence of the
anarchists is puerile and ridiculous. The whole muddle in which the anarchists find
themselves on account of their disagreements as to violence is an example of the
necessity of efficient and intelligent organization—which is exactly what government
in its essence is, to me (but is not now). My own position on anarchism has become
more clearly defined than before. I stand fundamentally with Montessori on the position
that the beginning and the end of revolution is improvement of the individual. I
should be prepared to endorse a brutal autocracy if that bred better human stock. I
am thoroughly convinced that Emma Goldman could preach until she lost her voice
without producing an appreciable effect. The world has had too much preaching.
There would be something finally tragic about the waste of such a personality as
hers unless there were a better way of accomplishing her object. She has been working
for years, yet ninety-nine per cent of Americans regard her as a sort of Carrie
Nation. The more we long for her success the more we appreciate her personality,
the more keenly we must criticise her method.

The question of how race hygiene must be applied is a profound and complex
matter, impossible of solution by any individual. It will be solved gradually, and as a
resultant of honest intellectual work by all forward looking people—more especially
by your despised scientists. It will be a matter of inspired scientific education, of
proper industrial conditions, of profound art stimulus, of sex reform, in short, of most
of the things advocated today by the socialist party. I have a fair-to-middling imagination,
but I totally fail to see how these things may properly be put into action without
intelligent governmental organization. We simply must not narrow our minds
by perfectionist generalities. It is the duty—and the inspiration—of the poet to understand
and use science, of the scientist to develop the poet in himself, of all to face
grimly every fact which concerns him and banish forever from his mind sentimentalism.
Sentimentalism about ribbons and candy is sometimes pretty, but sentimentalism
about the human race is a terrible form of blasphemy and the greatest of the sins
of pettiness.

Now that I have spoken honestly, don’t think I have joined the ranks of irascible

vision sweeping by the simple process of cutting off our view!

OBLOMOFFDOM
</h3>

</div>

<p class="from">
<em>Minnie Lyon, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
We are told by literary authorities that a certain Goncharoff occupies the place
next to Turgeniev and Tolstoy in Russian literature. As to this I cannot vouch, but
I can say that he has written a most profound and wonderful book called <em>Oblomoff</em>
wherein he has depicted in convincing terms the enthralling bondage of Russia’s intellectuals
in her days of stagnant inactivity. From this book was coined the phrase—“Russian
Malady of Oblomoffdom”, so well did it dissect her diseased and irresolute
will—a malady so universal as to make one feel that <em>Oblomoff</em> was written for
us as well as for Russia. It certainly is a direct emphasis upon a condition which
prevails so largely both in our personal and social life that few can read this inimitable
pen portrait without a sneaking feeling that some of his own lineaments are limned
therein.
</p>

<p>
Goncharoff writes of his hero: “The joy of higher inspiration was accessible to
him—the miseries of mankind were not strange to him.... Sometimes he cried
bitterly in the depths of his heart about human sorrows. He felt unnamed, unknown
sufferings and sadness, and a desire of going somewhere far away,—probably into that
world towards which Stoltz had tried to take him in his younger days. Sweet tears
would then flow upon his cheek. It would also happen that he would feel hatred
towards human vices, towards deceit, towards the evil which is spread all over the
world; and he would then feel the desire to show mankind its diseases. Thoughts
would then burn within him, rolling in his head like waves in the sea; they would
grow into decisions which would make all his blood boil; his muscles would be ready
to move, his sinews would be strained, intentions would be on the point of transforming
themselves into decisions.... Moved by a moral force he would rapidly
change over and over again his position in his bed; with a fixed stare he would
lift himself from it, move his hand, look about with inspired eyes ... the
inspiration would seem ready to realize itself, to transform itself into an act of
heroism—and then, what miracle, what admirable results might one not expect from so
great an effort! But—the morning would pass away, the shades of evening would
take the place of broad daylight—and with them the strained forces of Oblomoff
would incline towards rest—the storm in his soul would subside—his head would shake
off the worrying thoughts—his blood would circulate more slowly in his veins—and
Oblomoff would slowly turn over and recline on his back; look sadly through his
window upon the sky, following sadly with his eyes the sun which was setting
gloriously.... And how many times had he thus followed with his eyes that
sunset!”
</p>

<p>
How easy to fall back upon a soft bed of <em>concessions</em>—and drift into a world of
forgetfulness! It is just into terrible inertia—this every day and <em>every</em> day humdrum
conservatistic acceptance of things as they are—that <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> comes
with its laughter of the gods; it is so joyous, so fearless, so sure of its purpose, and
hurls itself against it with its vital young blood and its burning young heart, and
pleads with it for a re-creation of ideals in living, life, and art, and a bigger comprehension
of what life and art can mean to the individual and to the race, if the individual
will only open his heart and mind to these limitless freedoms. And it does not
say: “Look, this is the only way;” but “come all ye who have something to offer—only
let it be sincere, true, and unafraid.” And because of this big inclusiveness, we
sometimes hear our friend, the sophisticated critic, say: “It lacks sophistication.”—What
is sophistication anyway? Isn’t it something that has been baked and dried a

long time? I wonder if every thoughtful reader does not grow weary of petty criticism!
It is the twin sister (it has not the virility to be a boy twin) of Oblomoffdom,
and lives as a parasite upon the brains of others. (I like that word <em>Oblomoffdom</em>; it
covers such a multitude of indictments with an economy of words.) Let us have
criticism—yes, by all means; but let it <em>be</em> criticism—critical in values, illuminating in
meaning, clear in exposition, telling us how and <em>why</em>. Then we’ll give you our respectful
and unbiased attention. Too much of the stuff that passes as criticism is
merely a “personal attitude,” a channel for expressing a prejudice for (often) something
too big for the critic’s grasp. How often, too, does one grow a bit heart-weary
on hearing some big personality, some fine intellect limit itself to one vision—its
own.
</p>

<p>
Why not throw that attitude aside as an outworn garment, and welcome any force,
simply and gladly, that can stimulate a spark of life-urge within us? A more courageous
and intense love of truth, of men, of life.
</p>

<p>
And so, we welcome you, <span class="smallcaps">Little Review</span>, with a <em>Happy New Year</em> and a <em>long
life</em>—as a Rebel spirit amongst us, fighting our deadly Oblomoffdom.

Memories
</p>

<p class="ada">
By John Galsworthy
</p>

<p>
This is a charmingly sympathetic biographical sketch of a dog—a cocker
spaniel that came into the author’s possession almost at birth and remained with
him through life. It has none of the imaginative exaggeration common in modern
animal stories—records nothing improbable at all. But the author’s insight
and his power of interpretation individualize the little spaniel and bring him
into the reader’s intimate sympathy.

Half Hours
</p>

<p class="ada">
By J. M. Barrie
</p>

<p>
From the delightful, romantic fantasy of “Pantaloon” to the present-day
realism of “The Twelve Pound Look” represents the wide scope of Mr. Barrie’s
dramatic work. All four of the plays in this volume, though their subjects are
quite diverse, are beautifully suggestive of Barrie at his best with all his keenest
humor, brightest spontaneity, and deepest insight.

Notes on Novelists

With Some Other Notes
</p>

<p class="ada">
By Henry James
</p>

<p>
Here is a book which describes with penetrating analysis and in a thoroughly
entertaining manner of telling the work not only of the great modern
novelists of the last century, Stevenson, Zola, Balzac, Flaubert, and Thackeray,
but also takes up in a chapter entitled “The New Novel” the work of Galsworthy,
Mrs. Wharton, Conrad, Wells, Walpole, Bennett and the other more important
contemporary novelists. This chapter gives in a short space as keen
and authoritative a criticism of present-day fiction as can be found.

And Other Essays on Art Subjects
</p>

<p class="ada">
By Kenyon Cox
</p>

<p>
There is no one writing of art today with the vitality that fills every paragraph
of Mr. Cox’s work. Its freedom from what has become almost a conventional
jargon in much art criticism, and the essential interest of every comment
and suggestion, account for an altogether exceptional success that his book
on The Classic Spirit has had within the last few years, and that will be repeated
with this volume.

The Poems of Edgar Allen Poe
</p>

<p class="ads">
With an Introduction by E. C. Stedman and Notes by Professor G. E. Woodberry.
</p>

<p>
Nearly half a century passed after the death of Poe before the appearance
of the Stedman-Woodberry Edition of his works, which embodies in its editorial
departments critical scholarship of the highest class. In this volume of Poe’s
“Poems” the introduction and the notes treat not only of the more significant
aspects of Poe’s genius as a poet, but his technical methods, and of scores of
bibliographical and personal matters suggested by his verses. Entirely reset in
larger type.

In Dickens’ London
</p>

<p class="ada">
By F. Hopkinson Smith
</p>

<p>
The rare versatility of an author who can transfer to paper his impressions
of atmosphere as well in charcoal sketch as in charmingly told description
has made this book an inspiration to the lover of Dickens and to the lover of
London. The dusty old haunts of dusty old people, hid forever but for Dickens,
are visited again and found little changed. Where modern things have crept in
they are noticed with quick observation, keen humor, and that sympathy with
the human which the author shares with the great Dickens himself.

Robert Frank
</p>

<p class="ada">
By Sigurd Ibsen
</p>

<p>
Henry Ibsen’s only son is the author of this drama, which William Archer,
the distinguished English critic, considers convincing proof that he possesses,
“dramatic faculty in abundance.” Mr. Archer defines it as “a powerful and interesting
play which claims attention on its own merits,” “eminently a play of
today, or, rather, perhaps, of tomorrow.”

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
